# 2.1 Infant and Young Child Nutrition

## 2.1.1 Introduction

Improving infant and young child nutrition requires the implementation of a series of concerted
and systematic actions across the life cycle in normal and difficult circumstances that need to
be prioritized in Uganda.

This guideline explicitly incorporates guidance on IYCF practices in two broad categories:

1. Nutrition care and support under normal circumstances
2. Nutrition care and support in special circumstances including but not limited to
    emergencies, HIV infection, disabilities, pandemics etc. Children in these circumstances
    are at a high risk of malnutrition and, therefore, require special attention and support to
    ensure optimal IYCF.

## 2.1.2 Recommended actions to promote optimal nutrition in children in normal circumstances

### _normal circumstances_

Key implementation practices are recommended to ensure the protection, promotion, and
support of infant and young child nutrition in Uganda.

```
Recommended Action 1:
```
```
Counsel and support all pregnant women and mothers of children less than
two years to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of life and to exclusively
breastfeed their infants for the first six completed months of the infant’s life.
```
```
Recommended Action 2:
```
```
Counsel and support parents to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, and
appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age
while they continue breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.
```
```
Recommended Action 3:
```
```
Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified
diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh
fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources
and vegetable oil).
```

Breast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy
growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective
factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and
respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is
adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However,
medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided.

Babies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and
all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby
within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies

**BREASTFEEDING**


are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers
should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six
months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated.

Successful breastfeeding hinges largely on the Baby Friendly Health Facility Initiative (BFHI)^13 ,
and other facility and community-based interventions and involves the 14 requirements to
Successful Breastfeeding (Annex1), including compliance with the National Regulations on
Marketing of Infants and Young Foods (Annex 2). At the same time, it is very important to
continue advocating with employers to protect and support breastfeeding women also in the
workplace (Annex 3).

The recently revised draft BFHI standards reaffirm key principles^14 (Annex 4)^ for implementation
and assert the importance of looking at the responsibility of the health facilities for the provision
of the maternity and new-born services, to ensure that all health facilities comply with the revised
BFHI guidelines of Uganda^14. At the same time, the 14 requirements provide all the needed
information and guidance for the health workers to perform their work and responsibilities to
promote, protect and support breastfeeding.

Successful implementation of the interventions to promote nutrition of children include
breastfeeding counselling for pregnant women and mothers of children less than 2 years of age
,counselling and support should be continued throughout the breastfeeding period. Caregivers
should be counselled on the importance of good hygiene practices while caring for the child to
reduce the risk of diarrhoea and other illnesses (Box 1 for summary on key considerations for
optimal breastfeeding).


**Box 1: Summary of Key Considerations for Optimal Breastfeeding**

•	 Ensure that all health facilities offering maternity services implement the Baby Friendly
Health Facility Initiative (BFHI) and become certified as baby-friendly, according to the
BFHI requirements

•	 Implement monitoring and enforcement of the Regulations on the Marketing of
Infant and Young Child Foods according to the national law

•	 Ensure rooming in/bedding in of mothers and new-born infants

•	 Support mothers to initiate early contact with their new-born babies for at least
one hour, combined with the initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour

•	 Encourage mothers to feed their infants colostrum or “first milk”

•	 Counsel mothers to breastfeed frequently on demand, both by day and night

•	 Strengthen information and communication on the importance of avoiding pre-
lacteal feeds such as water, glucose water, teas, and herbal preparations for
new-born babies

•	 Support mothers to position and attach, the baby to the breast correctly, and to
completely empty one breast before offering the second, in order to ensure that
the infant gets the rich hind milk as well as to avoid breast problems

•	 Counsel and educate mothers on how to identify breastfeeding difficulties,
including breast conditions, and the need to promptly seek medical care from a
Ministry of Health approved provider, preferably in a baby friendly health facility

•	 Counsel m others to maintain a child health card or mother/child health passport
to monitor the growth and development of the child, to take their children
to health promotion sessions or the nearest health facility, to ensure timely
immunisation and to make sure that the child sleeps under an Insecticide
Treated Mosquito Net (ITN)

•	 Advocate for and ensure that employers protect and promote Maternity Rights
and Benefits

•	 Counsel mothers to practice responsive caregiving, and age appropriate play
and stimulation for the proper growth and development of the baby


## Complementary Feeding

When a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious,
and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate
complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins,
and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency,
Amount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations
(FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3.

Children have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting
with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23
months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to
the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating
soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.


**Recommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices**

```
•	 Counsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary
foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed
until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as
complementary foods (Annex 5).
•	 Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child,
the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day
and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between
meals (snacks)
•	 Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate.
Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be
thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse
•	 Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast
foods, sugar sweetened beverages).
•	 The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the
child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed.
•	 All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices
are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and
fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils.
•	 Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the
infant during feeding times
•	 Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements
every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six
months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old
•	 Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years
of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording
this growth
•	 Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal
duration of breastfeeding.
•	 Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation
practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.

#### circumstances................................................................................................... 2.1.3 Nutritional care and support for children 0–59 months old under “special”

**“Special” Circumstances**

This section presents the recommended actions to be followed in relation to special
circumstances where children are at higher risk of morbidity, malnutrition, and mortality. The
section provides guidance on nutrition care and support for low birth weight infants, infant
feeding in the context of HIV, Ebola, COVID-19, and infant feeding in emergencies.

**2.1.3.1 Infant Feeding Practices for Low Birth Weight babies**

Low birth Weight (LBW) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a weight at birth
of less than 2500 grams^6.

Being born with a low birth weight is a disadvantage for the infant and it contributes directly
and indirectly to neonatal deaths. National infant mortality rate can be reduced significantly
by improving nutrition care of low birth weight infants alongside temperature maintenance,
hygienic cord and skin care, and early detection and treatment of infections.

```
Recommended Action 4:
```
```
Counsel and support mothers of infants who are born with low birth weight
but can suckle to breast feed, unless there is a medical contraindication
```
```
Recommended Action 5:
```
```
Counsel and support mothers of low birth weight infants who cannot suckle
well to express breast milk and to give it by cup, spoon, or nasogastric tube.
```
Successful Implementation of interventions for nutrition of children with Low Birth Weight
should be in line with the WHO recommendations on Infant Feeding and Low Birth Weight^15
(Annex 6) and will involve the following:

```
•	 Low birth weight infants, including very low birth weight infants (weight between 1000g
and 1500g), should preferably be fed on breast milk and this should be exclusively until
six months
•	 Low birth weight infants who are clinically stable should be put to breastfeed as soon
as possible after birth
•	 Low birth weight babies less than 30 weeks gestational age should be cared for in a
health facility together with their mothers because pre-matures usually require feeding
through nasogastric tubes
•	 For very low birth weight infants in resource-limited settings, enteral feeds of 10ml/kg
per day should be provided, preferably of expressed breast milk, starting from the first
day of life, with the remaining fluid requirement met by intravenous fluid
•	 As they develop and are able to suckle on the breast, they can be cared for at home
using the kangaroo mother care technique
```

```
•	 Low birth weight infants who need to be fed by an alternative oral feeding method
should be fed by a cup (or palladia, a cup with a beak) or should be fed by a spoon
•	 Low birth weight infants who are fully or mostly fed by an alternative oral feeding
method should be fed on demand/infant hunger cues. Infants sleeping for more than
three hours should be woken up to feed
•	 Advise mothers to return as a follow up for all LBW babies to make sure that the agreed
action points are followed
•	 Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants fed on mother’s own milk or donor human milk
should be given 2–4mg/kg per day iron supplementation starting at two weeks until six
months of age.
```
**2.1.3.2 Infant Feeding in the Context of HIV Infection**

Appropriate breastfeeding practices for HIV affected mothers are necessary because of
the crucial benefits of breast milk to exposed infants that include; ability to provide optimal
nutrition, protection against common childhood infections and the high risk of death associated
with malnutrition. The risk of mother to baby transmission greatly decreases if exclusive breast
feeding and complementary feeding is practised as the mother adheres to Anti-Retroviral
Therapy (ART).

```
Recommended Action 6:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers to initiate breastfeeding within an hour of
delivery and to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six completed
months of the infant’s life
```
```
Recommended Action 7:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers living with HIV on adherence to antiretroviral
therapy while they continue breastfeeding until the baby is 12 months of age.
Adherence counselling should include all other prescribed medicines for the
mother and her baby.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition of children within the context of HIV
infection should be in line with the National Consolidated Guidelines for the Prevention, Care
and Treatment of HIV in Uganda (2018)^16 and will involve the following:

```
•	 Counsel all women living with HIV on the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for the first
six completed months of the infant’s life and establish the HIV exposure status of those
infants with unknown status.
```
```
o HIV Exposed Infants: Encourage mothers to discontinue breastfeeding at 12 months
of age for infants who are HIV negative. At least 500ml (1 NICE cup) a day of alternative
forms of milk (cow’s milk, goat’s milk and soya) should be given after breastfeeding has
been discontinued
```

```
o HIV Infected Infants: Encourage mothers to continue breastfeeding on demand, day
and night up to 24 months to maintain the baby’s health and nutrition
```
```
o HIV Exposed Sick Infant: Counsel the mother/caregiver to feed the child even more
frequently than usual to meet that child’s nutritional requirements (at least two extra
meals and one snack).
```
```
•	 Counsel the mothers living with HIV who decide to stop breastfeeding at any time, to do
so gradually. This transition period should be between one to two weeks which is not too
long to increase exposure and not too short to cause physical and psychological trauma to
the mother and baby. The mechanisms of transition include:
```
```
o Expressing breast milk and feeding infant or child by cup
```
```
o Encourage heat treatment in situations where the mother is non adherent to ARVs
```
```
o Substituting the expressed breast milk with suitable replacement feed gradually.
```
```
•	 Follow-up all HIV exposed infants and continue to offer infant feeding, counselling and
support to mothers/ caregivers
•	 Monitor growth and development of baby
•	 Introduce complementary feeding at six months and continue breastfeeding until 12
months
•	 Promptly manage breast problems like mastitis, cracked nipples etc.
```
**_2.1.3.3 Infant Feeding during Sickness (feeding the sick child)_**

Sickness in infants and young children, especially when associated with febrile illness, tends to
increase the metabolic rate, and thus contribute towards increased requirements for nutrients.
However, sickness often results in loss of appetite and decreased capacity of the infant and
young child to eat. It is important for the mother or caregiver to pay close attention to the
amount, frequency, consistency, and quality of the food being given to the sick infant and
young child.

```
Recommended Action 8:
```
```
Continue to breastfeed Sick and recuperating infants and children and feed
them on small, frequent meals of soft consistency and enriched with high
protein, fat, and mineral content.
```
Successful implementation of nutrition support for the sick child will involve the following:

**Sick Child less than six months:**

```
•	 Encourage mothers to breastfeed more frequently during illness, including diarrhoea,
to fight illness and to recover more quickly
```

```
•	 Counsel mothers to give only breast milk and medicines prescribed by the doctor/
health care provider
```
```
•	 Encourage mothers to increase the frequency of breastfeeding to help the child regain
health and weight after recovery from illness.
```
**Sick Children six months and above:**

```
•	 Encourage the breastfeeding mothers to continue breastfeeding
```
```
•	 Counsel the mothers to give one extra snack to children who are well; one extra meal
(or two snacks) at onset of sickness; and three extra meals (or two extra meals and
one snack) when sick and losing weight
```
```
•	 Encourage mothers to feed the child on high energy high protein foods for example;
enriching porridge with milk, groundnut paste, silver fish powder, eggs, and thickened
soups.
```
**_2.1.3.4 Infant Feeding for Children with Disabilities_**

Children with disabilities are at a particularly high risk of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition can
lead to or exacerbate disabilities. Studies suggest that children with disabilities may be up to
three times as likely to be malnourished as their peers. Many children with disabilities (around
80 per cent) have feeding difficulties such as choking, aspirating, or trouble sucking, chewing,
and swallowing1 7, 1 8. In addition to the nutrition care and support that all children 0–59 months
old should receive, children with feeding difficulties require adapted feeding and nutrition care.
Children with disabilities who are supported with growth monitoring, adequate nutrition, safe
and responsive feeding, and meaningful stimulation can thrive.

```
Recommended Action 9:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with children with disabilities to breastfeed their
infants as recommended under “normal” circumstances in these guidelines.
```
```
Start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, exclusively breastfeed for six months
and have timely introduction of adequate, safe, and properly prepared complementary
foods while continuing to breastfeed for two years of age or beyond.
```
```
Counsel mothers and caretakers of children with disabilities on safe feeding and
appropriate nutrition practices.
```

Successful implementation of nutrition support for children with disabilities will involve the
following:

```
•	 Monitor growth and development of children with disabilities using appropriate tools
and techniques
•	 Counsel parents and caretakers that good nutrition and responsive feeding help
children with disabilities to develop
•	 Encourage and support mothers to breastfeed or provide expressed milk for infants
with disabilities
•	 Counsel parents and caretakers in safe feeding practices for children with feeding
difficulties, including safe positioning and appropriate food textures
•	 Counsel parents and caretakers to provide a diverse diet to children with disabilities
using locally available, nutrient-dense foods
•	 Encourage parents and caretakers to help children with feeding difficulties develop
feeding skills safely
•	 Provide health workers with information on the relationship between nutrition and
disability, managing nutrition and feeding among children with disabilities, and
addressing related stigma
•	 Build the skills of health workers for the provision of skilled counselling and support to
caregivers with children with disabilities
•	 Link families with children with disabilities to community support systems.
```
**_2.1.3.5 Infant Feeding in the Context of Emergencies_**

Breastfeeding remains an important practice in emergency situations because it is safe,
acceptable, and affordable to many affected families. The focus, therefore, should be on
eliminating practices that undermine breastfeeding. Only when the mother is absent or
otherwise unable to breastfeed should replacement feeding be implemented. The special
needs of the women feeding infants and young children should be recognized and appropriate
support extended to them.

```
Recommended Action 10:
```
```
Counsel and support mothers, caretakers, and families to practice optimal
infant and young child feeding for all children (breastfed and non-breastfed) in
emergencies and other exceptionally difficult/special circumstances.
```
Successful implementation of nutrition interventions targeting children in emergency should
be in line with the global guidance on infant feeding in emergencies19 and will involve the
following:

```
•	 Protect, promote, and support early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding for all new-born
infants
```

•	 Protect, promote, and support exclusive breastfeeding in infants under six months of
age and continue breast feeding in children aged 6 months to 2 years or beyond

•	 Support caretakers to provide appropriate replacement feeds to infants whose mothers
are unavailable

•	 During emergencies, donations of infant formulas and infant foods are not encouraged,
EXCEPT in special circumstances where there is; mass loss of mothers, infants who
have medical indications or exposure of breastfeeding mothers to a life threatening agent
such as infections and radioactive materials, which may endanger the health of the child,
then donations in this case should comply with the standards, recommendations, and
principles of the Regulation for the Marketing of Infant and Young Child Foods19:

```
o Donated or subsidised supplies of breast milk substitutes (for example infant
formula) should be avoided. Donations of bottles and teats should not be
accepted in emergency situations. Any donations of breast milk substitutes,
bottles, and teats should be approved through the Nutrition Department,
Ministry of Health.
```
•	 A strict and evidence-based criteria for the provision of a breast milk substitute should
be used, and the procurement, management, and decisions regarding the use of breast
milk substitutes for those cases that have no other safer alternatives will be co-ordinated
by the MoH

•	 Ensure that children continue to be fed when they or their mothers fall sick. The feeding
should be even more frequent during illness and while the child is recovering.

•	 Integrate skilled breastfeeding counselling in services that target pregnant and breast-
feeding women and children 0-24 months

•	 Avoid separating mothers and their infants to facilitate continued feeding and care

•	 Health workers providing nutrition services in emergencies should have up to date infor-
mation about infant feeding policies, guidelines, practices and skills required to support
children and their caregivers in all aspects of IYCF

•	 Implement BFHI, as well as other forms of protection and promotion of breastfeeding,
and provide the necessary support to prevent spill-over of artificial feeding for those
mothers where breastfeeding is the best option

•	 Provide counselling and support on appropriate complementary feeding practices

•	 Appropriate foods should be provided to pregnant women, lactating mothers and their
children (6-23 months)

•	 Provide micronutrient supplementation (Vitamin A for children 6-59months, promote
use of fortified and bio fortified foods and point of use fortification with multiple micro-
nutrient powders, as needed

•	 Address the nutritional needs of the women and children living with HIV in emergency
situations


```
•	 Collaborate with other sectors like WASH, gender, food security to ensure that MIYCAN
sensitive activities are carried out.
```
**_2.1.3.6 Infant Feeding during Hepatitis Infection_**

Hepatitis A virus is transmitted predominantly through the oral faecal route, through person-
to-person contact or ingestion of contaminated food or water. The infection is characterized by
an acute febrile illness and with jaundice (yellow colouration of the skin and eyes). New-born
babies are rarely infected, severe disease is rare and chronic infection does not occur.

Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through sexual intercourse, perinatally, and rarely from mother-
to-child during pregnancy. Hepatitis B virus antibodies have been detected in breast milk, but
studies have shown that breastfeeding by positive women does not significantly increase risk
of infection among their infants.

Hepatitis C virus can be transmitted by contact with blood or blood products through transfusion,
sexual intercourse, or needle-stick exposure. Overall, the risk of perinatal transmission appears
extremely low and several studies demonstrate no increased risk of transmission through
breastfeeding^6. The recommendations below focus on Hepatitis B infections.

```
Recommended Action 11:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with Hepatitis A, B, and C to breastfeed their
infants as recommended under “normal” circumstances in these guidelines.
```
```
Start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, be exclusively breastfed for six
months and have timely introduction of adequate, safe, and properly prepared
complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for two years of age or
beyond.
```
```
Vaccinate mothers and children against hepatitis according to the National
Hepatitis Immunisation Guidelines.
```
Implementation of nutrition interventions targeting women and children affected by Hepatitis
A, B, and C are similar to interventions of children born to women in normal circumstances.
Other interventions include:

```
•	 Utilize families and communities, who are central in supporting optimal infant and young
child feeding and improving infant health, to serve as resources for counselling, practical
support to mothers for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, solving problems,
negotiating with caregivers and facilitating interactive peer sessions
```
```
•	 Observe appropriate WASH practices in relation to Hepatitis A virus.
```

**_2.1.3.7 Infant Feeding in Context of Haemorrhagic Viral Infections_**

The epidemic prone haemorrhagic viral infections such as Ebola and Zika viruses, pose
special challenges to breastfeeding due to the incubation period after exposure that is usually
asymptomatic.The specific guidance provided as part of the epidemic response should be
closely adhered to.

**Zika Virus**

For the case of infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed Zika Virus
infection, or who reside in or have travelled to areas with ongoing Zika Virus transmission,
should be fed according to normal infant feeding guidelines. They should start breastfeeding
within one hour after birth, be exclusively breastfed for six months and have timely introduction
to adequate, safe and properly prepared complementary foods, while continuing breastfeeding
up to two years of age or beyond^6

```
Recommended Action 12:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with haemorrhagic viral infection whether
suspected or confirmed Zika cases to feed their infants according to the normal
infant feeding guidelines.
```
```
Start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, exclusively breastfeed for six
months and have timely introduction to adequate, safe, and properly prepared
complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for two years of age or
beyond.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition support during cases of haemorrhagic
viral infections will involve the following:

```
•	 Provide skilled support in initiation and continuation of breastfeeding to mothers who
decide to breastfeed, whether they or their infants have suspected, probable or confirmed
Zika Virus infection
```
```
•	 Provide skilled feeding support from health professionals to mothers and families of
infants born with congenital anomalies (e.g. microcephaly), or those presenting with
feeding difficulties, to breastfeed their infants
```
```
•	 Utilize families and communities, who are central in supporting optimal infant and young
child feeding and improving infant health, to serve as resources for counselling, practical
support to mothers for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, solving problems,
negotiating with caregivers and facilitating interactive peer sessions
```
```
•	 Make health workers aware of the complex set of values around breastfeeding, to better
equip them to support pregnant and lactating women with their infant-feeding choices,
even in the context of an outbreak
```

```
•	 Engage multidisciplinary teams for infants who need specialist support in infant feeding,
especially for infants who have difficulty breastfeeding. This may be the case for infants
born with congenital anomalies, including microcephaly, and long-term management
may be necessary.
```
**Ebola Virus Disease.**

Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) can be transmitted via body fluids, including breast milk.A
breastfeeding mother with symptoms of Ebola increases the risk of transmission to the baby.
Although replacement feeding with breast milk substitutes has high risks of morbidity and
mortality, the safest feeding option for infants less than six months of age in the context of
Ebola is Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF) due to presence of Ebola virus in breast milk and
high risk of spread of EVD through contact^20.

```
Recommended Action 13:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers and children exposed to the virus to use
Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF) for all infants below the age of six months
in the context of EVD. Start complementary foods, including animal milk, at
six months of age until they make 23 months.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition support of cases of EVD will involve
counselling on replacement feeding as well as psychosocial support to all mothers and children
who have been exposed to the virus.

**Asymptomatic Infant less than six months of age + Confirmed Ebola Infected mother:**

```
•	 Isolate the mother from the child
•	 Start replacement feeding with Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF)
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Confirmed Ebola Infected infant less than six months of age + Confirmed Ebola Infected
mother:**

```
•	 Support mother to continue breastfeeding if she can do so
•	 Provide replacement feeding with RUIF if mother is not able to breastfeed
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Negative EVD mother + Confirmed Ebola Infected infant less than six months:**

```
•	 Separate mother from child
•	 Support mother to express breast milk if she is able to do so
•	 Start replacement feeding with RUIF if mother not able to express breast milk
```

```
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Asymptomatic Child 6–23 months of age + Confirmed Ebola Infected mother, or Confirmed
Ebola Infected Child 6 –23 months of age + Asymptomatic Mother:**

```
•	 Separate the mother from the child
•	 Provide nutritionally adequate, safe and age appropriate complementary foods, including
Ultra Heat-Treated milk (UHT) or animal milk
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Infant and Young Child Feeding recommendations after recovery from Ebola Virus Disease:**

```
•	 Do not resume breastfeeding of infants and young children whose mothers have recov-
ered from Ebola
•	 Ebola virus remains in breast milk including other body fluids even if cleared from blood
•	 Children below six months of age whose mothers have recovered from Ebola should be
fed on RUIF until six complete months of age
•	 However, if the mother and baby are both Ebola survivors, resume breastfeeding if the
mother is able
•	 Introduce appropriate nutritionally adequate, safe and age appropriate complementary
foods (see Annex 5), including Ultra Heat-Treated milk (UHT) or animal milk at six
completed months of age
•	 Provide Ready to Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) (100g) or super cereal flour (200g) to
all recovered infants and young children (6–23 months) for 30 days
•	 Ensure psycho-social support and follow up at community level.
```
The recommendation to discontinue breastfeeding if both the breastfeeding woman and the
breastfed child have acute EVD is based on a hypothetical risk of viral ‘boosting’ between two
infected individuals. This viral boosting could theoretically increase disease severity through
additional viraemic exposure. Evidence to directly support this recommendation is lacking.

```
•	 Rapid testing of breast milk of women with recovered EVD, who would like to continue
to breastfeed, should be prioritized.
```
```
•	 Women’s choices related to stopping breastfeeding or continuing after EVD recovery
and testing of breast milk, should be respected, and supported by health care workers
to facilitate the choice.

**_2.1.3.8 Infant Feeding in Context of Influenza and Covid -19_**

There has been no documentation of vertical transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy,
delivery, or breastfeeding. The recent evidence show that no active virus has been found in the
breast milk samples from the mothers after the first lactation, at the same time it is important
to reaffirm that breastfeeding protects against morbidity and death in the post-neonatal period
and throughout infancy and childhood. Breast feeding protects against infectious diseases
through direct transfer of antibodies and other anti-infective factors and long-lasting transfer of


immunological competence and memory.

Therefore, during COVID-19, standard infant feeding guidelines should be followed with
appropriate precautions for Infection Preventive Control (IPC) as stated in the recommendations
below21,22,23,24,25,26.

```
Recommended Action 14:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with influenza to feed children according
to normal infant feeding practices. Start breastfeeding within one hour after
birth, be exclusively breastfed for six months and have timely introduction of
adequate safe and properly prepared complementary foods while continuing
to breastfeed for two years of age or beyond.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition support during cases of influenza will
involve the following:

In line with WHO recommendations^6 all infants should be fed according to normal infant feeding
guidelines.

```
o They should start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, be exclusively breastfed
for six months, and continue to breastfeed up to two years of age or beyond, with the
addition of adequate complementary foods from about six months of age, including
during periods of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) circulation
```
```
o If the mother is ill with influenza, she should follow measures to prevent transmission.
These include covering mouth and nose when she coughs and sneezes while caring for
and breastfeeding the baby, as well as performing frequent hand hygiene. The mother
can continue breastfeeding, even if she is ill and on antiviral medicines. She should
take additional fluids, especially if she has fever. If severe maternal illness prevents the
mother from feeding the infant at her breast, she should be helped to express her breast
milk and feed it to the infant by cup or cup and spoon.
```
**For Coronavirus (SARS 2, COVID-19)**

```
Recommended Action 15:
```
```
Counsel and support all mother with COVID-19 whether suspected or
confirmed to practice the normal infant feeding guidelines while adhering to
the recommended Infection Prevention and Control measures.
```
```
They should start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, continue exclusive
breastfeeding for six months and have timely introduction of adequate safe
and properly prepared complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed
for two years of age or beyond.
```

In line with Global recommendations21,22,23,24 and the Ministry of Health25,26, the following
Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) for infant and young child feeding during COVID-19
should be followed:

```
•	 Always wear a medical mask when feeding or near a child if mother/caregiver has
respiratory symptoms
```
```
•	 Wash hands with soap and water before and after contact with the child
```
```
•	 Routinely clean with soap clothes for both mother and child
```
```
•	 Routinely clean with soap surfaces and other areas of contact for both mother/caregiver
and child
```
```
•	 Maintain physical distancing with other people and avoid touching eyes, nose, and
mouth.
```
Follow the infant and young child feeding decision tree in line with the MoH guidance^ (see
Annex 7).

**When the Mother and/or the Child are Negative:**

```
•	 Mothers and infants should be enabled to practice skin-to-skin contact, kangaroo mother
care and to remain together and to practice rooming-in throughout the day and night. This
is important especially immediately after birth during establishment of breastfeeding,
whether they or their infants have suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19
```
```
•	 Support the mother to initiate breastfeeding within one hour after birth
```
```
•	 Support the mother to give only breast milk to infants below six months of age
```
```
•	 Ensure appropriate complementary feeding practices for children 6–23 months at least
five times a day
```
```
•	 Encourage frequent breastfeeding to increase fluid intake
```
```
•	 Provide breastfeeding counseling to the mother
```
```
•	 Provide psychosocial support to both the mother and child
```
```
•	 Children should continue breastfeeding during and after recovery from COVID-19.
```
```
When Confirmed COVID-19 Positive Breastfeeding Mother and Negative baby:
```
```
•	 Infected or affected lactating mothers should not be isolated together with other general
patients. A separate isolation room should be offered to provide an enabling environment
for breastfeeding and to reduce the exposure to the baby
```
```
•	 Support the mothers to breastfeed according to the above guidelines while taking
necessary precautions to limit viral spread to the baby for example wearing a face mask,
avoid coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding at the breast, washing hands
before and after touching the baby or breast pump
```

```
•	 Support mothers to hand express their breast milk and feed the infants using a cup
```
```
•	 Always provide psychosocial support to both the mother and infant.
```
**When the baby is COVID-19 positive, but the mother is negative:**

```
•	 Isolate the baby and mother away from other COVID-19 patients on the ward if possible,
in a side room. In case a side room is not available, a designated section of the ward
should be reserved for only mothers and their children
```
```
•	 Encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding according to the above guidelines. The
mother should be given full PPE (mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves) to wear to
avoid contracting COVID-19 infection from other positive patients on the ward.
```
When the child is not breastfeeding or above two years of age is confirmed COVID-19 positive
and the mother is negative:

Priority should be given to nursing the child in a side room.  Two options can be considered:

```
o The children can be separated from the mother and the child nursed and taken
care of by the nursing staff on the ward
o The mother can be taught and given clear instructions and provided with full PPE
(mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves) to protect her from getting infected by
the baby or other positive patients on the ward BUT allowed to take care of her
child on the ward. The mother should be encouraged to undertake regular hand
hygiene with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub after handling the child.
```
**When the Mother is Suspected, Probable, or Confirmed COVID-19 but unable to continue
direct Breastfeeding.**

```
•	 Support mother to express breast milk:
```
```
o The milk can be given to the infant using a cup with a wide mouth, or using a
spoon Using a bottle is not advised; bottles are difficult to clean, they require
sterilisation and can be a source of infection if not well cleaned. In addition, using
a bottle makes it more difficult for the baby to return to the mother’s breast when
she becomes well again
o Expressed breast milk in a closed container or covered with a cloth or plate at
room temperature stays for up to eight hours
o If stored in a sterile container, expressed breast milk can be kept for 24 hours at
18–20 degrees centigrade in a shady place, for about 72 hours in a refrigerator
and for about four months in a freezer (at -18 to -20 degrees centigrade)
```
```
•	 Start replacement feeding with Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF) if the infant is less
than six months of age and mother is unwell to express breast milk
```
```
•	 Provide psychosocial support to both the mother and infant.
```

**During COVID-19 pandemic, the Complementary Feeding for children 6–23 months of
age remains critical and needs to be supported as following:**

```
•	 Encourage mother to continue breastfeeding on demand
```
```
•	 Provide Ultra-Heat Treated (UHT) milk and complementary feeds if the infant is 6–23
months of age
```
```
•	 Young children need to consume a variety of foods to meet their nutrient needs and
expose them to various tastes and textures
```
```
•	 Avoid drinks or foods with low nutritional value, such as sugar-sweetened beverages,
candy, chips, and other foods high in sugar, salt and trans fats
```
```
•	 Provide psychosocial support to both the mother and infant.
