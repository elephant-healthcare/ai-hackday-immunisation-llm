## 2.2 ADOLESCENT NUTRITION

### 2.2.1 Introduction

Adolescence is a period characterized by rapid physical growth as the individual transitions
from childhood to adulthood, which results in increased demand for nutrients.

Improving adolescent girls’ nutrition and delaying their first pregnancy is an effective intervention
to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition that Uganda is currently facing. This guideline
is in line with the existing policies and global recommendations on adolescent health 27,28,29 and
points out how adolescents should receive health and nutrition services plus support from
health facilities, schools, their families, and communities.

Optimal nutrition and sufficient physical activity improve child well-being and learning ability,
leading to better academic performance. School settings offer many opportunities for delivering
simple health and nutrition interventions to school children including promoting physical activity.

#### 2.2.2 Objectives.........................................................................................................

Within the context of adolescent nutrition, the objectives of the guidelines are as follows:

1. To provide guidance on prevention and managing under nutrition, overweight and obesity
    among adolescents in Uganda
2. To promote provision of quality adolescent-friendly nutrition services at the health facility
    and community levels.

**Nutrition among Adolescents**

**_2.2.3.1 Promoting Healthy Diet_**

Adolescence is a period characterized by rapid physical growth as the individual transitions from
childhood to adulthood, which results in increased demand for nutrients. However, adolescence
is also associated with atypical behaviour especially among females, which includes food fads
and selective preference for types of food. This can influence the amount of food intake and/or
reserves of different nutrients, which in turn can predispose the adolescent to malnutrition. The
strategic intervention is based upon the adoption of a healthy eating lifestyle by adolescents.

```
Recommended Action 16:
```
```
Counsel and support adolescent girls and boys on healthy eating behaviours
(eating a variety of nutrient rich foods, avoiding foods high in salt, sugar, and
fats)
```
Successful implementation will involve the following to prevent overweight and obesity,
undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among adolescent girls and boys:

```
•	 Education and counselling on healthy eating behaviours to include;
```

```
o Eating a variety of foods and avoiding foods with high salt, fat, and sugar content
(e.g. sweetened or carbonated drinks, fast foods, sweet and salty snacks)
•	 Promote consumption of fortified foods (e.g. fortified flour) and bio fortified foods at
home and in schools
```
```
•	 Provide iron and folic acid supplementation to menstruating adolescent girls to prevent
anaemia in line with the national implementation guide for Health Sector Component of
the Uganda Multi-Sectoral Food Security and Nutrition 30
```
```
•	 Promote the use of iodized salt among adolescents for the prevention and control of
iodine-deficiency disorders
```
```
•	 Provide periodic deworming treatment to control and/or prevent iron deficiency and
anaemia in adolescents (10–14 years)30
```
```
•	 Integrate good nutrition and physical exercise for adolescents in relative seminars,
classes, orientations and other adolescent friendly spaces and school health clubs.
```
**_2.2.3.2 Promoting Physical Activity_**

The adolescence period is usually associated with a relatively high level of physical activity/
exercises.Nevertheless, there is a growing trend towards less physical activity among
adolescents due to preference for computerized indoor games over the outdoor vigorous
exercises. This has contributed towards overweight and obesity among the adolescents as
well as other conditions associated with sedentary lifestyles.

```
Recommended Action 17:
```
```
Promote physical activity/exercises among adolescent boys and girls.
```
Successful implementation should be in line with global recommendations^31 and MoH polices
and guidelines^28 and will involve the following:

```
•	 Counselling for adolescents to accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate-to vigorous-
intensity physical activity daily, most of which should be aerobic. Physical activity of at
least 60 minutes daily will provide additional health benefits
```
```
•	 Vigorous-intensity activities, including those that strengthen muscle and bone, should
be incorporated at least three times per week
```
```
•	 Encourage adolescents to engage in physical activities like play, games, sports, riding,
cycling, walking, recreation, physical education, or planned exercise, in the context of
family, school, and community activities.
```
**_2.2.3.3 Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases_**

Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and other infections that affect the adolescent’s sexual


and reproductive health can have a negative impact on the nutritional status of the individual.
This is partly due to the stigma that accompany such conditions and the challenge faced by
adolescents in accessing good quality care services.

```
Recommended Action 18:
```
```
Educate and counsel adolescents on prevention of sexually transmitted
diseases and other infections.
```
Successful implementation will involve the following:

```
•	 Counselling on prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) including HIV
```
```
•	 Prevention of malaria and other infestations e.g. hookworms
```
```
•	 Early and timely management of STDs and other infections.
```
**_2.2.3.4 Prevention of Early Pregnancies_**

The nutritional needs of pregnant adolescents are like those of other mothers, since their
bodies are still developing, younger adolescents compete with the foetus for nourishment,
thus exhausting iron, and other nutrient reserves. As a result, nutritional deficiencies such as
iron deficiency anaemia are more common among the pregnant adolescents, and their babies
are more likely to be born prematurely and tend to have high levels of morbidity and mortality.

```
Recommended Action 19:
```
```
Educate and counsel adolescents on delaying first pregnancy
```
Successful implementation will require following:

```
•	 Encourage adolescents to remain longer in schools and increase educational opportunities
through formal and non-formal channels
```
```
•	 Educate and counsel on family planning and delay first pregnancy till at least 18 years of
age
```
```
•	 Encourage political and community leaders to enforce by-laws and policies that prohibit
marriage of girls before the age of 18 years. The Ministry of Gender Labour and Social
Development relies on 1) the Penal Code Act that out-laws sex before the age of 18
years, therefore, marriage and 2) The Constitution of Uganda that states start of family
from the age of 18 years. Hence, the child protection prohibits marriage of girls before
the age of 18 years.
```

**_2.2.3.5 Adolescent-Friendly Nutrition Services_**

All adolescents are eligible for health services, provided in a friendly environment and manner
that meets their needs regardless of education, gender, age, religion, or any other discriminatory
factor. Adolescent-friendly nutrition services shall be integrated within the existing health care
delivery system at all levels and within the community interventions.

```
Recommended Action 20:
```
```
Integrate nutrition services in adolescent-friendly platforms at the health
facility, community, and school levels.
```
Successful implementation will involve the following actions:

```
•	 Assess nutrition status of the adolescent girls and boys
```
```
•	 Provide nutrition counselling among adolescents on all forms of malnutrition
```
```
•	 Provide adolescent nutrition counselling across the different reproductive health services
```
```
•	 Include nutrition in school curriculum of adolescents
```
```
o Provide safe and clean water, sanitation, and hygiene
o (WASH) and promote appropriate hygiene practices to reduce the risk of illnesses.
