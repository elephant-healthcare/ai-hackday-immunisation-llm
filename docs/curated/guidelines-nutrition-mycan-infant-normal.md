# 2.1 Infant and Young Child Nutrition


## 2.1.2 Recommended actions to promote optimal nutrition in children in normal circumstances

Key implementation practices are recommended to ensure the protection, promotion, and
support of infant and young child nutrition in Uganda.

```
Recommended Action 1:
```
```
Counsel and support all pregnant women and mothers of children less than two years to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of life and to exclusively
breastfeed their infants for the first six completed months of the infant’s life.

```
```
Recommended Action 2:
```
```
Counsel and support parents to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, and appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age while they continue breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.
```
```
Recommended Action 3:
```
```
Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh
fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources
and vegetable oil).
```

Breast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy
growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective
factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and
respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is
adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However,
medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided.

Babies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers
should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six
months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated.


### Complementary Feeding

When a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious, and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins,
and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency, 

Amount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations
(FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3.

Children have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to
the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating
soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.


**Recommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices**

```
•	 Counsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as
complementary foods (Annex 5).
•	 Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between
meals (snacks)
•	 Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse
•	 Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages).
•	 The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed.
•	 All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils.
•	 Encourage parents to practice active feeding,  meaning that they should interact with the infant during feeding times
•	 Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old
•	 Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording this growth
•	 Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal duration of breastfeeding.
•	 Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.

**_Table 2: Summary of the Complementary Feeding Practices_**

| Age Group       | 6–8 Months                                       | 9–11 Months                                       | 12–23 Months                                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Frequency**  | • 2–3 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding; based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered | • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. | • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. |
| **Amount**     | • Start with 2–3 tablespoons per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup | • ½ cup of a 250 ml at each meal | • ¾ of a 250 ml cup at each meal |
| **Thickness (consistency)** | • Start with thick porridge, well mashed foods. Continue with mashed family foods  <br> • Foods prepared with treated water. | • Finely chopped or mashed food and foods that the baby can pick up with his/her fingers  <br> • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. | • Family foods, chopped or mashed if necessary  <br> • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. |
| **Variety**    | \- Encourage mothers to include at least one type of locally available food from the three main food groups: Carbohydrates/fats/oils (energy-giving foods), plant/animal protein (bodybuilding), and vegetables and fruits (protecting foods). |
| **Active/Responsive Feeding** | \- Mothers should be encouraged to feed their infants and young children patiently and actively and to use a separate plate for the infant to ensure adequate intake. |
| **Hygiene**    | \- Counsel mothers on hygienic food preparation and handling to avoid food contamination leading to diarrhoea and illness. Encourage the use of clean, open cups. Discourage use of feeding bottles, teats, or spouted cups as they are very difficult to clean. |
