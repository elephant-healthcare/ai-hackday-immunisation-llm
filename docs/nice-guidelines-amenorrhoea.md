## Amenorrhoea: Summary

* Amenorrhoea is the absence or cessation of menstruation.   
  * Primary amenorrhoea is defined as the failure to establish menstruation by the expected age, variably considered to be 15 or 16 years of age in girls with normal secondary sexual characteristics (such as breast development), or 13 or 14 years of age in girls with no secondary sexual characteristics.  
  * Secondary amenorrhoea is defined as the cessation of previously established menstruation for 3 cycles or for 6 or more months.  
* There are many possible causes of amenorrhoea, including physiological states; outflow tract obstruction; genetic and congenital conditions; disorders of the ovaries, hypothalamus, or pituitary gland; and disorders of other endocrine glands.  
  * The more common causes of primary amenorrhoea include anatomical abnormalities due to genetic or congenital conditions, functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (related to eating disorders, stress, weight loss, and excessive exercise) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  
  * The more common causes of secondary amenorrhoea include polycystic ovary syndrome, functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea, premature ovarian insufficiency, and hyperprolactinaemia.  
* A thorough history and examination should be done to help identify the cause of amenorrhoea. The following preliminary investigations may be considered in primary care to aid diagnosis and/or guide referral:  
  * Ultrasound.  
  * Serum prolactin.  
  * Thyroid-stimulating hormone.  
  * Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).  
  * Oestradiol.  
  * Total testosterone (if there are features of androgen excess).  
* Referral for specialist investigation, and where appropriate management of the underlying cause, is indicated for those with primary amenorrhoea.  
* Referral to a gynaecologist should be arranged for women with secondary amenorrhoea and any of the following:  
  * Elevated FSH and LH levels (and younger than 40 years of age).  
  * Recent history of uterine or cervical surgery, or severe pelvic infection.  
  * Infertility.  
  * Suspected PCOS where the diagnosis is unclear or where there are complications that cannot be managed in primary care.   
* Referral to an endocrinologist should be arranged for women with secondary amenorrhoea and any of the following:  
  * Hyperprolactinaemia.  
  * Low FSH and LH.  
  * An increased testosterone level not explained by PCOS.  
  * Features of Cushing's syndrome or late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  
* Women with secondary amenorrhoea due to PCOS, hypothyroidism, menopause, or pregnancy should be managed in primary care, where appropriate.  
* Amenorrhoea caused by weight loss, excessive exercise, stress, or chronic illness may be managed in primary care after an endocrinologist has assessed and excluded other hypothalamic or pituitary causes (such as a tumour). However, if an eating disorder is suspected, a prompt referral should be made to an age-appropriate community eating disorders service.
