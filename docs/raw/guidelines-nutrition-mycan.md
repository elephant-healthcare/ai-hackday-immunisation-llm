```
Interventions integrated at all service contact points
within health facilities and the community targeting
the new-born, infants, young children, adolescents,
and women.
Dietary Diversity Diverse diets includes meals consisting of foods
from a variety of food groups in each day including:
breast milk; greens, roots and tubers; beans, nuts
and seeds; dairy (milk, yoghurt, cheese); flesh
foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver/organ meats);
eggs; Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables (carrots,

months of age.
```
```
Integration Provision of interventions to avoid duplication,
improve efficiency and promote synergy.
```
```
New-born (Neonate) MoH defines a New-born as a baby from birth up to

**Stunting** A form of undernutrition, also known as chronic
undernutrition. It is growth failure resulting from
prolonged or repeated episodes of undernutrition.
Stunting or low-height for age is defined by a height-
for-age (HAZ) z-score below two SDs of the median
WHO standards.

**Systems Approach** A  systems approach  to  health  is one that applies
scientific insights to understand the elements
that influence  health  outcomes; models the
relationships between those elements; and alters
design, processes, or policies based on the resultant
knowledge in order to produce better health at lower
cost.
It also refers to actions by different sectors or
systems to improve maternal infant, young child and
adolescent nutrition. Systems approach engages
other systems including food, health water and
sanitation, education and social protection to deliver
nutritious diets, essential nutrition services, and
positive nutrition practices for children, adolescents
and women.

**Undernutrition** Undernutrition includes wasting (low weight for
height), stunting (low height for age) and underweight
(low weight for age). Illness and insufficient intake
and/or inadequate absorption of energy, protein or
micronutrients to meet an individual’s needs required
by the body for maintenance and growth that in turn
leads to nutritional deficiency.

**Wasting** Also known as ‘acute malnutrition’, wasting is
characterized by a rapid deterioration in nutritional
status over a short period of time. In children, it can
be measured using the weight-for-height nutritional
index or mid-upper arm circumference. There are
different levels of severity of acute malnutrition:
Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe
Acute Malnutrition (SAM). Technically defined as
below minus two standard deviations from median
weight-for-height of a reference population

**Women of Reproductive Age** MoH defines WRA as females from the age of 15
years and above up to 49 years of age

**Young Child** MoH defines a young child as a child from the age of
12 months up to 59 months of age.

**Low Birth Weight babies** Babies with a birth weight less than 2.5kg or 2500g
at birth.

**Very Low Birth Weight** Babies with a birth weight of between 1000g to
1500g.

# 2.1 Infant and Young Child Nutrition

## 2.1.1 Introduction

Improving infant and young child nutrition requires the implementation of a series of concerted
and systematic actions across the life cycle in normal and difficult circumstances that need to
be prioritized in Uganda.

This guideline explicitly incorporates guidance on IYCF practices in two broad categories:

1. Nutrition care and support under normal circumstances
2. Nutrition care and support in special circumstances including but not limited to
    emergencies, HIV infection, disabilities, pandemics etc. Children in these circumstances
    are at a high risk of malnutrition and, therefore, require special attention and support to
    ensure optimal IYCF.

## 2.1.2 Recommended actions to promote optimal nutrition in children in normal circumstances

### _normal circumstances_

Key implementation practices are recommended to ensure the protection, promotion, and
support of infant and young child nutrition in Uganda.

```
Recommended Action 1:
```
```
Counsel and support all pregnant women and mothers of children less than
two years to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of life and to exclusively
breastfeed their infants for the first six completed months of the infant’s life.
```
```
Recommended Action 2:
```
```
Counsel and support parents to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, and
appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age
while they continue breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.
```
```
Recommended Action 3:
```
```
Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified
diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh
fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources
and vegetable oil).
```

Breast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy
growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective
factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and
respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is
adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However,
medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided.

Babies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and
all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby
within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies

**BREASTFEEDING**


are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers
should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six
months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated.

Successful breastfeeding hinges largely on the Baby Friendly Health Facility Initiative (BFHI)^13 ,
and other facility and community-based interventions and involves the 14 requirements to
Successful Breastfeeding (Annex1), including compliance with the National Regulations on
Marketing of Infants and Young Foods (Annex 2). At the same time, it is very important to
continue advocating with employers to protect and support breastfeeding women also in the
workplace (Annex 3).

The recently revised draft BFHI standards reaffirm key principles^14 (Annex 4)^ for implementation
and assert the importance of looking at the responsibility of the health facilities for the provision
of the maternity and new-born services, to ensure that all health facilities comply with the revised
BFHI guidelines of Uganda^14. At the same time, the 14 requirements provide all the needed
information and guidance for the health workers to perform their work and responsibilities to
promote, protect and support breastfeeding.

Successful implementation of the interventions to promote nutrition of children include
breastfeeding counselling for pregnant women and mothers of children less than 2 years of age
,counselling and support should be continued throughout the breastfeeding period. Caregivers
should be counselled on the importance of good hygiene practices while caring for the child to
reduce the risk of diarrhoea and other illnesses (Box 1 for summary on key considerations for
optimal breastfeeding).


**Box 1: Summary of Key Considerations for Optimal Breastfeeding**

•	 Ensure that all health facilities offering maternity services implement the Baby Friendly
Health Facility Initiative (BFHI) and become certified as baby-friendly, according to the
BFHI requirements

•	 Implement monitoring and enforcement of the Regulations on the Marketing of
Infant and Young Child Foods according to the national law

•	 Ensure rooming in/bedding in of mothers and new-born infants

•	 Support mothers to initiate early contact with their new-born babies for at least
one hour, combined with the initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour

•	 Encourage mothers to feed their infants colostrum or “first milk”

•	 Counsel mothers to breastfeed frequently on demand, both by day and night

•	 Strengthen information and communication on the importance of avoiding pre-
lacteal feeds such as water, glucose water, teas, and herbal preparations for
new-born babies

•	 Support mothers to position and attach, the baby to the breast correctly, and to
completely empty one breast before offering the second, in order to ensure that
the infant gets the rich hind milk as well as to avoid breast problems

•	 Counsel and educate mothers on how to identify breastfeeding difficulties,
including breast conditions, and the need to promptly seek medical care from a
Ministry of Health approved provider, preferably in a baby friendly health facility

•	 Counsel m others to maintain a child health card or mother/child health passport
to monitor the growth and development of the child, to take their children
to health promotion sessions or the nearest health facility, to ensure timely
immunisation and to make sure that the child sleeps under an Insecticide
Treated Mosquito Net (ITN)

•	 Advocate for and ensure that employers protect and promote Maternity Rights
and Benefits

•	 Counsel mothers to practice responsive caregiving, and age appropriate play
and stimulation for the proper growth and development of the baby


## Complementary Feeding

When a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious,
and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate
complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins,
and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency,
Amount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations
(FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3.

Children have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting
with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23
months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to
the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating
soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.


**Recommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices**

```
•	 Counsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary
foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed
until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as
complementary foods (Annex 5).
•	 Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child,
the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day
and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between
meals (snacks)
•	 Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate.
Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be
thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse
•	 Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast
foods, sugar sweetened beverages).
•	 The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the
child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed.
•	 All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices
are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and
fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils.
•	 Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the
infant during feeding times
•	 Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements
every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six
months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old
•	 Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years
of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording
this growth
•	 Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal
duration of breastfeeding.
•	 Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation
practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.

#### circumstances................................................................................................... 2.1.3 Nutritional care and support for children 0–59 months old under “special”

**“Special” Circumstances**

This section presents the recommended actions to be followed in relation to special
circumstances where children are at higher risk of morbidity, malnutrition, and mortality. The
section provides guidance on nutrition care and support for low birth weight infants, infant
feeding in the context of HIV, Ebola, COVID-19, and infant feeding in emergencies.

**2.1.3.1 Infant Feeding Practices for Low Birth Weight babies**

Low birth Weight (LBW) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a weight at birth
of less than 2500 grams^6.

Being born with a low birth weight is a disadvantage for the infant and it contributes directly
and indirectly to neonatal deaths. National infant mortality rate can be reduced significantly
by improving nutrition care of low birth weight infants alongside temperature maintenance,
hygienic cord and skin care, and early detection and treatment of infections.

```
Recommended Action 4:
```
```
Counsel and support mothers of infants who are born with low birth weight
but can suckle to breast feed, unless there is a medical contraindication
```
```
Recommended Action 5:
```
```
Counsel and support mothers of low birth weight infants who cannot suckle
well to express breast milk and to give it by cup, spoon, or nasogastric tube.
```
Successful Implementation of interventions for nutrition of children with Low Birth Weight
should be in line with the WHO recommendations on Infant Feeding and Low Birth Weight^15
(Annex 6) and will involve the following:

```
•	 Low birth weight infants, including very low birth weight infants (weight between 1000g
and 1500g), should preferably be fed on breast milk and this should be exclusively until
six months
•	 Low birth weight infants who are clinically stable should be put to breastfeed as soon
as possible after birth
•	 Low birth weight babies less than 30 weeks gestational age should be cared for in a
health facility together with their mothers because pre-matures usually require feeding
through nasogastric tubes
•	 For very low birth weight infants in resource-limited settings, enteral feeds of 10ml/kg
per day should be provided, preferably of expressed breast milk, starting from the first
day of life, with the remaining fluid requirement met by intravenous fluid
•	 As they develop and are able to suckle on the breast, they can be cared for at home
using the kangaroo mother care technique
```

```
•	 Low birth weight infants who need to be fed by an alternative oral feeding method
should be fed by a cup (or palladia, a cup with a beak) or should be fed by a spoon
•	 Low birth weight infants who are fully or mostly fed by an alternative oral feeding
method should be fed on demand/infant hunger cues. Infants sleeping for more than
three hours should be woken up to feed
•	 Advise mothers to return as a follow up for all LBW babies to make sure that the agreed
action points are followed
•	 Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants fed on mother’s own milk or donor human milk
should be given 2–4mg/kg per day iron supplementation starting at two weeks until six
months of age.
```
**2.1.3.2 Infant Feeding in the Context of HIV Infection**

Appropriate breastfeeding practices for HIV affected mothers are necessary because of
the crucial benefits of breast milk to exposed infants that include; ability to provide optimal
nutrition, protection against common childhood infections and the high risk of death associated
with malnutrition. The risk of mother to baby transmission greatly decreases if exclusive breast
feeding and complementary feeding is practised as the mother adheres to Anti-Retroviral
Therapy (ART).

```
Recommended Action 6:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers to initiate breastfeeding within an hour of
delivery and to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six completed
months of the infant’s life
```
```
Recommended Action 7:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers living with HIV on adherence to antiretroviral
therapy while they continue breastfeeding until the baby is 12 months of age.
Adherence counselling should include all other prescribed medicines for the
mother and her baby.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition of children within the context of HIV
infection should be in line with the National Consolidated Guidelines for the Prevention, Care
and Treatment of HIV in Uganda (2018)^16 and will involve the following:

```
•	 Counsel all women living with HIV on the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for the first
six completed months of the infant’s life and establish the HIV exposure status of those
infants with unknown status.
```
```
o HIV Exposed Infants: Encourage mothers to discontinue breastfeeding at 12 months
of age for infants who are HIV negative. At least 500ml (1 NICE cup) a day of alternative
forms of milk (cow’s milk, goat’s milk and soya) should be given after breastfeeding has
been discontinued
```

```
o HIV Infected Infants: Encourage mothers to continue breastfeeding on demand, day
and night up to 24 months to maintain the baby’s health and nutrition
```
```
o HIV Exposed Sick Infant: Counsel the mother/caregiver to feed the child even more
frequently than usual to meet that child’s nutritional requirements (at least two extra
meals and one snack).
```
```
•	 Counsel the mothers living with HIV who decide to stop breastfeeding at any time, to do
so gradually. This transition period should be between one to two weeks which is not too
long to increase exposure and not too short to cause physical and psychological trauma to
the mother and baby. The mechanisms of transition include:
```
```
o Expressing breast milk and feeding infant or child by cup
```
```
o Encourage heat treatment in situations where the mother is non adherent to ARVs
```
```
o Substituting the expressed breast milk with suitable replacement feed gradually.
```
```
•	 Follow-up all HIV exposed infants and continue to offer infant feeding, counselling and
support to mothers/ caregivers
•	 Monitor growth and development of baby
•	 Introduce complementary feeding at six months and continue breastfeeding until 12
months
•	 Promptly manage breast problems like mastitis, cracked nipples etc.
```
**_2.1.3.3 Infant Feeding during Sickness (feeding the sick child)_**

Sickness in infants and young children, especially when associated with febrile illness, tends to
increase the metabolic rate, and thus contribute towards increased requirements for nutrients.
However, sickness often results in loss of appetite and decreased capacity of the infant and
young child to eat. It is important for the mother or caregiver to pay close attention to the
amount, frequency, consistency, and quality of the food being given to the sick infant and
young child.

```
Recommended Action 8:
```
```
Continue to breastfeed Sick and recuperating infants and children and feed
them on small, frequent meals of soft consistency and enriched with high
protein, fat, and mineral content.
```
Successful implementation of nutrition support for the sick child will involve the following:

**Sick Child less than six months:**

```
•	 Encourage mothers to breastfeed more frequently during illness, including diarrhoea,
to fight illness and to recover more quickly
```

```
•	 Counsel mothers to give only breast milk and medicines prescribed by the doctor/
health care provider
```
```
•	 Encourage mothers to increase the frequency of breastfeeding to help the child regain
health and weight after recovery from illness.
```
**Sick Children six months and above:**

```
•	 Encourage the breastfeeding mothers to continue breastfeeding
```
```
•	 Counsel the mothers to give one extra snack to children who are well; one extra meal
(or two snacks) at onset of sickness; and three extra meals (or two extra meals and
one snack) when sick and losing weight
```
```
•	 Encourage mothers to feed the child on high energy high protein foods for example;
enriching porridge with milk, groundnut paste, silver fish powder, eggs, and thickened
soups.
```
**_2.1.3.4 Infant Feeding for Children with Disabilities_**

Children with disabilities are at a particularly high risk of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition can
lead to or exacerbate disabilities. Studies suggest that children with disabilities may be up to
three times as likely to be malnourished as their peers. Many children with disabilities (around
80 per cent) have feeding difficulties such as choking, aspirating, or trouble sucking, chewing,
and swallowing1 7, 1 8. In addition to the nutrition care and support that all children 0–59 months
old should receive, children with feeding difficulties require adapted feeding and nutrition care.
Children with disabilities who are supported with growth monitoring, adequate nutrition, safe
and responsive feeding, and meaningful stimulation can thrive.

```
Recommended Action 9:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with children with disabilities to breastfeed their
infants as recommended under “normal” circumstances in these guidelines.
```
```
Start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, exclusively breastfeed for six months
and have timely introduction of adequate, safe, and properly prepared complementary
foods while continuing to breastfeed for two years of age or beyond.
```
```
Counsel mothers and caretakers of children with disabilities on safe feeding and
appropriate nutrition practices.
```

Successful implementation of nutrition support for children with disabilities will involve the
following:

```
•	 Monitor growth and development of children with disabilities using appropriate tools
and techniques
•	 Counsel parents and caretakers that good nutrition and responsive feeding help
children with disabilities to develop
•	 Encourage and support mothers to breastfeed or provide expressed milk for infants
with disabilities
•	 Counsel parents and caretakers in safe feeding practices for children with feeding
difficulties, including safe positioning and appropriate food textures
•	 Counsel parents and caretakers to provide a diverse diet to children with disabilities
using locally available, nutrient-dense foods
•	 Encourage parents and caretakers to help children with feeding difficulties develop
feeding skills safely
•	 Provide health workers with information on the relationship between nutrition and
disability, managing nutrition and feeding among children with disabilities, and
addressing related stigma
•	 Build the skills of health workers for the provision of skilled counselling and support to
caregivers with children with disabilities
•	 Link families with children with disabilities to community support systems.
```
**_2.1.3.5 Infant Feeding in the Context of Emergencies_**

Breastfeeding remains an important practice in emergency situations because it is safe,
acceptable, and affordable to many affected families. The focus, therefore, should be on
eliminating practices that undermine breastfeeding. Only when the mother is absent or
otherwise unable to breastfeed should replacement feeding be implemented. The special
needs of the women feeding infants and young children should be recognized and appropriate
support extended to them.

```
Recommended Action 10:
```
```
Counsel and support mothers, caretakers, and families to practice optimal
infant and young child feeding for all children (breastfed and non-breastfed) in
emergencies and other exceptionally difficult/special circumstances.
```
Successful implementation of nutrition interventions targeting children in emergency should
be in line with the global guidance on infant feeding in emergencies19 and will involve the
following:

```
•	 Protect, promote, and support early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding for all new-born
infants
```

•	 Protect, promote, and support exclusive breastfeeding in infants under six months of
age and continue breast feeding in children aged 6 months to 2 years or beyond

•	 Support caretakers to provide appropriate replacement feeds to infants whose mothers
are unavailable

•	 During emergencies, donations of infant formulas and infant foods are not encouraged,
EXCEPT in special circumstances where there is; mass loss of mothers, infants who
have medical indications or exposure of breastfeeding mothers to a life threatening agent
such as infections and radioactive materials, which may endanger the health of the child,
then donations in this case should comply with the standards, recommendations, and
principles of the Regulation for the Marketing of Infant and Young Child Foods19:

```
o Donated or subsidised supplies of breast milk substitutes (for example infant
formula) should be avoided. Donations of bottles and teats should not be
accepted in emergency situations. Any donations of breast milk substitutes,
bottles, and teats should be approved through the Nutrition Department,
Ministry of Health.
```
•	 A strict and evidence-based criteria for the provision of a breast milk substitute should
be used, and the procurement, management, and decisions regarding the use of breast
milk substitutes for those cases that have no other safer alternatives will be co-ordinated
by the MoH

•	 Ensure that children continue to be fed when they or their mothers fall sick. The feeding
should be even more frequent during illness and while the child is recovering.

•	 Integrate skilled breastfeeding counselling in services that target pregnant and breast-
feeding women and children 0-24 months

•	 Avoid separating mothers and their infants to facilitate continued feeding and care

•	 Health workers providing nutrition services in emergencies should have up to date infor-
mation about infant feeding policies, guidelines, practices and skills required to support
children and their caregivers in all aspects of IYCF

•	 Implement BFHI, as well as other forms of protection and promotion of breastfeeding,
and provide the necessary support to prevent spill-over of artificial feeding for those
mothers where breastfeeding is the best option

•	 Provide counselling and support on appropriate complementary feeding practices

•	 Appropriate foods should be provided to pregnant women, lactating mothers and their
children (6-23 months)

•	 Provide micronutrient supplementation (Vitamin A for children 6-59months, promote
use of fortified and bio fortified foods and point of use fortification with multiple micro-
nutrient powders, as needed

•	 Address the nutritional needs of the women and children living with HIV in emergency
situations


```
•	 Collaborate with other sectors like WASH, gender, food security to ensure that MIYCAN
sensitive activities are carried out.
```
**_2.1.3.6 Infant Feeding during Hepatitis Infection_**

Hepatitis A virus is transmitted predominantly through the oral faecal route, through person-
to-person contact or ingestion of contaminated food or water. The infection is characterized by
an acute febrile illness and with jaundice (yellow colouration of the skin and eyes). New-born
babies are rarely infected, severe disease is rare and chronic infection does not occur.

Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through sexual intercourse, perinatally, and rarely from mother-
to-child during pregnancy. Hepatitis B virus antibodies have been detected in breast milk, but
studies have shown that breastfeeding by positive women does not significantly increase risk
of infection among their infants.

Hepatitis C virus can be transmitted by contact with blood or blood products through transfusion,
sexual intercourse, or needle-stick exposure. Overall, the risk of perinatal transmission appears
extremely low and several studies demonstrate no increased risk of transmission through
breastfeeding^6. The recommendations below focus on Hepatitis B infections.

```
Recommended Action 11:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with Hepatitis A, B, and C to breastfeed their
infants as recommended under “normal” circumstances in these guidelines.
```
```
Start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, be exclusively breastfed for six
months and have timely introduction of adequate, safe, and properly prepared
complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for two years of age or
beyond.
```
```
Vaccinate mothers and children against hepatitis according to the National
Hepatitis Immunisation Guidelines.
```
Implementation of nutrition interventions targeting women and children affected by Hepatitis
A, B, and C are similar to interventions of children born to women in normal circumstances.
Other interventions include:

```
•	 Utilize families and communities, who are central in supporting optimal infant and young
child feeding and improving infant health, to serve as resources for counselling, practical
support to mothers for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, solving problems,
negotiating with caregivers and facilitating interactive peer sessions
```
```
•	 Observe appropriate WASH practices in relation to Hepatitis A virus.
```

**_2.1.3.7 Infant Feeding in Context of Haemorrhagic Viral Infections_**

The epidemic prone haemorrhagic viral infections such as Ebola and Zika viruses, pose
special challenges to breastfeeding due to the incubation period after exposure that is usually
asymptomatic.The specific guidance provided as part of the epidemic response should be
closely adhered to.

**Zika Virus**

For the case of infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed Zika Virus
infection, or who reside in or have travelled to areas with ongoing Zika Virus transmission,
should be fed according to normal infant feeding guidelines. They should start breastfeeding
within one hour after birth, be exclusively breastfed for six months and have timely introduction
to adequate, safe and properly prepared complementary foods, while continuing breastfeeding
up to two years of age or beyond^6

```
Recommended Action 12:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with haemorrhagic viral infection whether
suspected or confirmed Zika cases to feed their infants according to the normal
infant feeding guidelines.
```
```
Start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, exclusively breastfeed for six
months and have timely introduction to adequate, safe, and properly prepared
complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for two years of age or
beyond.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition support during cases of haemorrhagic
viral infections will involve the following:

```
•	 Provide skilled support in initiation and continuation of breastfeeding to mothers who
decide to breastfeed, whether they or their infants have suspected, probable or confirmed
Zika Virus infection
```
```
•	 Provide skilled feeding support from health professionals to mothers and families of
infants born with congenital anomalies (e.g. microcephaly), or those presenting with
feeding difficulties, to breastfeed their infants
```
```
•	 Utilize families and communities, who are central in supporting optimal infant and young
child feeding and improving infant health, to serve as resources for counselling, practical
support to mothers for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, solving problems,
negotiating with caregivers and facilitating interactive peer sessions
```
```
•	 Make health workers aware of the complex set of values around breastfeeding, to better
equip them to support pregnant and lactating women with their infant-feeding choices,
even in the context of an outbreak
```

```
•	 Engage multidisciplinary teams for infants who need specialist support in infant feeding,
especially for infants who have difficulty breastfeeding. This may be the case for infants
born with congenital anomalies, including microcephaly, and long-term management
may be necessary.
```
**Ebola Virus Disease.**

Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) can be transmitted via body fluids, including breast milk.A
breastfeeding mother with symptoms of Ebola increases the risk of transmission to the baby.
Although replacement feeding with breast milk substitutes has high risks of morbidity and
mortality, the safest feeding option for infants less than six months of age in the context of
Ebola is Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF) due to presence of Ebola virus in breast milk and
high risk of spread of EVD through contact^20.

```
Recommended Action 13:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers and children exposed to the virus to use
Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF) for all infants below the age of six months
in the context of EVD. Start complementary foods, including animal milk, at
six months of age until they make 23 months.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition support of cases of EVD will involve
counselling on replacement feeding as well as psychosocial support to all mothers and children
who have been exposed to the virus.

**Asymptomatic Infant less than six months of age + Confirmed Ebola Infected mother:**

```
•	 Isolate the mother from the child
•	 Start replacement feeding with Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF)
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Confirmed Ebola Infected infant less than six months of age + Confirmed Ebola Infected
mother:**

```
•	 Support mother to continue breastfeeding if she can do so
•	 Provide replacement feeding with RUIF if mother is not able to breastfeed
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Negative EVD mother + Confirmed Ebola Infected infant less than six months:**

```
•	 Separate mother from child
•	 Support mother to express breast milk if she is able to do so
•	 Start replacement feeding with RUIF if mother not able to express breast milk
```

```
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Asymptomatic Child 6–23 months of age + Confirmed Ebola Infected mother, or Confirmed
Ebola Infected Child 6 –23 months of age + Asymptomatic Mother:**

```
•	 Separate the mother from the child
•	 Provide nutritionally adequate, safe and age appropriate complementary foods, including
Ultra Heat-Treated milk (UHT) or animal milk
•	 Give psycho-social support to child and mother.
```
**Infant and Young Child Feeding recommendations after recovery from Ebola Virus Disease:**

```
•	 Do not resume breastfeeding of infants and young children whose mothers have recov-
ered from Ebola
•	 Ebola virus remains in breast milk including other body fluids even if cleared from blood
•	 Children below six months of age whose mothers have recovered from Ebola should be
fed on RUIF until six complete months of age
•	 However, if the mother and baby are both Ebola survivors, resume breastfeeding if the
mother is able
•	 Introduce appropriate nutritionally adequate, safe and age appropriate complementary
foods (see Annex 5), including Ultra Heat-Treated milk (UHT) or animal milk at six
completed months of age
•	 Provide Ready to Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) (100g) or super cereal flour (200g) to
all recovered infants and young children (6–23 months) for 30 days
•	 Ensure psycho-social support and follow up at community level.
```
The recommendation to discontinue breastfeeding if both the breastfeeding woman and the
breastfed child have acute EVD is based on a hypothetical risk of viral ‘boosting’ between two
infected individuals. This viral boosting could theoretically increase disease severity through
additional viraemic exposure. Evidence to directly support this recommendation is lacking.

```
•	 Rapid testing of breast milk of women with recovered EVD, who would like to continue
to breastfeed, should be prioritized.
```
```
•	 Women’s choices related to stopping breastfeeding or continuing after EVD recovery
and testing of breast milk, should be respected, and supported by health care workers
to facilitate the choice.
```
**_2.1.3.8 Infant Feeding in Context of Influenza and Covid -19_**

There has been no documentation of vertical transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy,
delivery, or breastfeeding. The recent evidence show that no active virus has been found in the
breast milk samples from the mothers after the first lactation, at the same time it is important
to reaffirm that breastfeeding protects against morbidity and death in the post-neonatal period
and throughout infancy and childhood. Breast feeding protects against infectious diseases
through direct transfer of antibodies and other anti-infective factors and long-lasting transfer of


immunological competence and memory.

Therefore, during COVID-19, standard infant feeding guidelines should be followed with
appropriate precautions for Infection Preventive Control (IPC) as stated in the recommendations
below21,22,23,24,25,26.

```
Recommended Action 14:
```
```
Counsel and support all mothers with influenza to feed children according
to normal infant feeding practices. Start breastfeeding within one hour after
birth, be exclusively breastfed for six months and have timely introduction of
adequate safe and properly prepared complementary foods while continuing
to breastfeed for two years of age or beyond.
```
Successful implementation of interventions for nutrition support during cases of influenza will
involve the following:

In line with WHO recommendations^6 all infants should be fed according to normal infant feeding
guidelines.

```
o They should start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, be exclusively breastfed
for six months, and continue to breastfeed up to two years of age or beyond, with the
addition of adequate complementary foods from about six months of age, including
during periods of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) circulation
```
```
o If the mother is ill with influenza, she should follow measures to prevent transmission.
These include covering mouth and nose when she coughs and sneezes while caring for
and breastfeeding the baby, as well as performing frequent hand hygiene. The mother
can continue breastfeeding, even if she is ill and on antiviral medicines. She should
take additional fluids, especially if she has fever. If severe maternal illness prevents the
mother from feeding the infant at her breast, she should be helped to express her breast
milk and feed it to the infant by cup or cup and spoon.
```
**For Coronavirus (SARS 2, COVID-19)**

```
Recommended Action 15:
```
```
Counsel and support all mother with COVID-19 whether suspected or
confirmed to practice the normal infant feeding guidelines while adhering to
the recommended Infection Prevention and Control measures.
```
```
They should start breastfeeding within one hour after birth, continue exclusive
breastfeeding for six months and have timely introduction of adequate safe
and properly prepared complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed
for two years of age or beyond.
```

In line with Global recommendations21,22,23,24 and the Ministry of Health25,26, the following
Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) for infant and young child feeding during COVID-19
should be followed:

```
•	 Always wear a medical mask when feeding or near a child if mother/caregiver has
respiratory symptoms
```
```
•	 Wash hands with soap and water before and after contact with the child
```
```
•	 Routinely clean with soap clothes for both mother and child
```
```
•	 Routinely clean with soap surfaces and other areas of contact for both mother/caregiver
and child
```
```
•	 Maintain physical distancing with other people and avoid touching eyes, nose, and
mouth.
```
Follow the infant and young child feeding decision tree in line with the MoH guidance^ (see
Annex 7).

**When the Mother and/or the Child are Negative:**

```
•	 Mothers and infants should be enabled to practice skin-to-skin contact, kangaroo mother
care and to remain together and to practice rooming-in throughout the day and night. This
is important especially immediately after birth during establishment of breastfeeding,
whether they or their infants have suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19
```
```
•	 Support the mother to initiate breastfeeding within one hour after birth
```
```
•	 Support the mother to give only breast milk to infants below six months of age
```
```
•	 Ensure appropriate complementary feeding practices for children 6–23 months at least
five times a day
```
```
•	 Encourage frequent breastfeeding to increase fluid intake
```
```
•	 Provide breastfeeding counseling to the mother
```
```
•	 Provide psychosocial support to both the mother and child
```
```
•	 Children should continue breastfeeding during and after recovery from COVID-19.
```
```
When Confirmed COVID-19 Positive Breastfeeding Mother and Negative baby:
```
```
•	 Infected or affected lactating mothers should not be isolated together with other general
patients. A separate isolation room should be offered to provide an enabling environment
for breastfeeding and to reduce the exposure to the baby
```
```
•	 Support the mothers to breastfeed according to the above guidelines while taking
necessary precautions to limit viral spread to the baby for example wearing a face mask,
avoid coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding at the breast, washing hands
before and after touching the baby or breast pump
```

```
•	 Support mothers to hand express their breast milk and feed the infants using a cup
```
```
•	 Always provide psychosocial support to both the mother and infant.
```
**When the baby is COVID-19 positive, but the mother is negative:**

```
•	 Isolate the baby and mother away from other COVID-19 patients on the ward if possible,
in a side room. In case a side room is not available, a designated section of the ward
should be reserved for only mothers and their children
```
```
•	 Encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding according to the above guidelines. The
mother should be given full PPE (mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves) to wear to
avoid contracting COVID-19 infection from other positive patients on the ward.
```
When the child is not breastfeeding or above two years of age is confirmed COVID-19 positive
and the mother is negative:

Priority should be given to nursing the child in a side room.  Two options can be considered:

```
o The children can be separated from the mother and the child nursed and taken
care of by the nursing staff on the ward
o The mother can be taught and given clear instructions and provided with full PPE
(mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves) to protect her from getting infected by
the baby or other positive patients on the ward BUT allowed to take care of her
child on the ward. The mother should be encouraged to undertake regular hand
hygiene with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub after handling the child.
```
**When the Mother is Suspected, Probable, or Confirmed COVID-19 but unable to continue
direct Breastfeeding.**

```
•	 Support mother to express breast milk:
```
```
o The milk can be given to the infant using a cup with a wide mouth, or using a
spoon Using a bottle is not advised; bottles are difficult to clean, they require
sterilisation and can be a source of infection if not well cleaned. In addition, using
a bottle makes it more difficult for the baby to return to the mother’s breast when
she becomes well again
o Expressed breast milk in a closed container or covered with a cloth or plate at
room temperature stays for up to eight hours
o If stored in a sterile container, expressed breast milk can be kept for 24 hours at
18–20 degrees centigrade in a shady place, for about 72 hours in a refrigerator
and for about four months in a freezer (at -18 to -20 degrees centigrade)
```
```
•	 Start replacement feeding with Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF) if the infant is less
than six months of age and mother is unwell to express breast milk
```
```
•	 Provide psychosocial support to both the mother and infant.
```

**During COVID-19 pandemic, the Complementary Feeding for children 6–23 months of
age remains critical and needs to be supported as following:**

```
•	 Encourage mother to continue breastfeeding on demand
```
```
•	 Provide Ultra-Heat Treated (UHT) milk and complementary feeds if the infant is 6–23
months of age
```
```
•	 Young children need to consume a variety of foods to meet their nutrient needs and
expose them to various tastes and textures
```
```
•	 Avoid drinks or foods with low nutritional value, such as sugar-sweetened beverages,
candy, chips, and other foods high in sugar, salt and trans fats
```
```
•	 Provide psychosocial support to both the mother and infant.


## 2.2 ADOLESCENT NUTRITION

### 2.2.1 Introduction

Adolescence is a period characterized by rapid physical growth as the individual transitions
from childhood to adulthood, which results in increased demand for nutrients.

Improving adolescent girls’ nutrition and delaying their first pregnancy is an effective intervention
to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition that Uganda is currently facing. This guideline
is in line with the existing policies and global recommendations on adolescent health 27,28,29 and
points out how adolescents should receive health and nutrition services plus support from
health facilities, schools, their families, and communities.

Optimal nutrition and sufficient physical activity improve child well-being and learning ability,
leading to better academic performance. School settings offer many opportunities for delivering
simple health and nutrition interventions to school children including promoting physical activity.

#### 2.2.2 Objectives.........................................................................................................

Within the context of adolescent nutrition, the objectives of the guidelines are as follows:

1. To provide guidance on prevention and managing under nutrition, overweight and obesity
    among adolescents in Uganda
2. To promote provision of quality adolescent-friendly nutrition services at the health facility
    and community levels.

#### adolescents....................................................................................................... 2.2.3 Recommended actions to promote and support optimal nutrition among

**Nutrition among Adolescents**

**_2.2.3.1 Promoting Healthy Diet_**

Adolescence is a period characterized by rapid physical growth as the individual transitions from
childhood to adulthood, which results in increased demand for nutrients. However, adolescence
is also associated with atypical behaviour especially among females, which includes food fads
and selective preference for types of food. This can influence the amount of food intake and/or
reserves of different nutrients, which in turn can predispose the adolescent to malnutrition. The
strategic intervention is based upon the adoption of a healthy eating lifestyle by adolescents.

```
Recommended Action 16:
```
```
Counsel and support adolescent girls and boys on healthy eating behaviours
(eating a variety of nutrient rich foods, avoiding foods high in salt, sugar, and
fats)
```
Successful implementation will involve the following to prevent overweight and obesity,
undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among adolescent girls and boys:

```
•	 Education and counselling on healthy eating behaviours to include;
```

```
o Eating a variety of foods and avoiding foods with high salt, fat, and sugar content
(e.g. sweetened or carbonated drinks, fast foods, sweet and salty snacks)
•	 Promote consumption of fortified foods (e.g. fortified flour) and bio fortified foods at
home and in schools
```
```
•	 Provide iron and folic acid supplementation to menstruating adolescent girls to prevent
anaemia in line with the national implementation guide for Health Sector Component of
the Uganda Multi-Sectoral Food Security and Nutrition 30
```
```
•	 Promote the use of iodized salt among adolescents for the prevention and control of
iodine-deficiency disorders
```
```
•	 Provide periodic deworming treatment to control and/or prevent iron deficiency and
anaemia in adolescents (10–14 years)30
```
```
•	 Integrate good nutrition and physical exercise for adolescents in relative seminars,
classes, orientations and other adolescent friendly spaces and school health clubs.
```
**_2.2.3.2 Promoting Physical Activity_**

The adolescence period is usually associated with a relatively high level of physical activity/
exercises.Nevertheless, there is a growing trend towards less physical activity among
adolescents due to preference for computerized indoor games over the outdoor vigorous
exercises. This has contributed towards overweight and obesity among the adolescents as
well as other conditions associated with sedentary lifestyles.

```
Recommended Action 17:
```
```
Promote physical activity/exercises among adolescent boys and girls.
```
Successful implementation should be in line with global recommendations^31 and MoH polices
and guidelines^28 and will involve the following:

```
•	 Counselling for adolescents to accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate-to vigorous-
intensity physical activity daily, most of which should be aerobic. Physical activity of at
least 60 minutes daily will provide additional health benefits
```
```
•	 Vigorous-intensity activities, including those that strengthen muscle and bone, should
be incorporated at least three times per week
```
```
•	 Encourage adolescents to engage in physical activities like play, games, sports, riding,
cycling, walking, recreation, physical education, or planned exercise, in the context of
family, school, and community activities.
```
**_2.2.3.3 Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases_**

Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and other infections that affect the adolescent’s sexual


and reproductive health can have a negative impact on the nutritional status of the individual.
This is partly due to the stigma that accompany such conditions and the challenge faced by
adolescents in accessing good quality care services.

```
Recommended Action 18:
```
```
Educate and counsel adolescents on prevention of sexually transmitted
diseases and other infections.
```
Successful implementation will involve the following:

```
•	 Counselling on prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) including HIV
```
```
•	 Prevention of malaria and other infestations e.g. hookworms
```
```
•	 Early and timely management of STDs and other infections.
```
**_2.2.3.4 Prevention of Early Pregnancies_**

The nutritional needs of pregnant adolescents are like those of other mothers, since their
bodies are still developing, younger adolescents compete with the foetus for nourishment,
thus exhausting iron, and other nutrient reserves. As a result, nutritional deficiencies such as
iron deficiency anaemia are more common among the pregnant adolescents, and their babies
are more likely to be born prematurely and tend to have high levels of morbidity and mortality.

```
Recommended Action 19:
```
```
Educate and counsel adolescents on delaying first pregnancy
```
Successful implementation will require following:

```
•	 Encourage adolescents to remain longer in schools and increase educational opportunities
through formal and non-formal channels
```
```
•	 Educate and counsel on family planning and delay first pregnancy till at least 18 years of
age
```
```
•	 Encourage political and community leaders to enforce by-laws and policies that prohibit
marriage of girls before the age of 18 years. The Ministry of Gender Labour and Social
Development relies on 1) the Penal Code Act that out-laws sex before the age of 18
years, therefore, marriage and 2) The Constitution of Uganda that states start of family
from the age of 18 years. Hence, the child protection prohibits marriage of girls before
the age of 18 years.
```

**_2.2.3.5 Adolescent-Friendly Nutrition Services_**

All adolescents are eligible for health services, provided in a friendly environment and manner
that meets their needs regardless of education, gender, age, religion, or any other discriminatory
factor. Adolescent-friendly nutrition services shall be integrated within the existing health care
delivery system at all levels and within the community interventions.

```
Recommended Action 20:
```
```
Integrate nutrition services in adolescent-friendly platforms at the health
facility, community, and school levels.
```
Successful implementation will involve the following actions:

```
•	 Assess nutrition status of the adolescent girls and boys
```
```
•	 Provide nutrition counselling among adolescents on all forms of malnutrition
```
```
•	 Provide adolescent nutrition counselling across the different reproductive health services
```
```
•	 Include nutrition in school curriculum of adolescents
```
```
o Provide safe and clean water, sanitation, and hygiene
o (WASH) and promote appropriate hygiene practices to reduce the risk of illnesses.
```

## 2.3 MATERNAL NUTRITION

## 2.3.1 Introduction

Malnutrition in pregnant women contribute to an intergenerational cycle of nutrition problems,
which manifest as stillbirths, miscarriages, low birth weight babies, growth failure, increased risk
of maternal and neonatal mortality, impaired cognitive development, sub-optimal productivity in
adults and reduced economic growth for the nation. Efforts geared to preventing malnutrition
in women with a focus before, during and after pregnancy and during breastfeeding is the
direction of the government in breaking this intergenerational cycle and its manifestations.

A mother’s nutritional status, diet and lifestyle, therefore, influences pregnancy and lactation
outcomes and can have lasting effects on her offspring’s health. For optimal child development
outcomes, maternal physical and mental health should be coordinated. In other words,
interventions to promote the survival and wellbeing of both children and their caregivers should
be prioritized for optimal early childhood development. Preventing maternal malnutrition should
encompass programmes empowering women with knowledge and information on healthy
diets and nutrition to improve their nutrient intake as well as monitoring weight gain during
pregnancy and prevention and control of micronutrient deficiencies. This guideline builds onto
the maternal nutrition guidelines of 2010^32.

### 2.3.2 Objectives.........................................................................................................

Within the context of maternal nutrition, the objectives of the guidelines are as follows:

1. To provide a framework for prevention of under nutrition, anaemia, overweight, and
    obesity among the pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers
2. To promote provision of quality maternal nutrition services at the health facility and
    community levels.

#### .......................................................................................................................... 2.3.3 Recommended actions to promote and support optimal maternal nutrition

**_2.3.3.1 Nutrition Education and Counselling on Healthy Diet_**

There are increased macro- and micro-nutrient needs during pregnancy to cater for growth
of the foetus, placenta, and other maternal tissues, which call for extra energy and protein
intake. Without corresponding increased intake, the body’s own reserves are used, leaving
the pregnant woman weakened and vulnerable to maternal and foetal complications, including
death. Antenatal care offers an opportunity to assess and monitor the nutritional status of a
pregnant woman throughout the period.

Nutritional requirements during the post-partum period are greater than during pregnancy due
to the need to produce breast milk, promote recovery and sustain the mother’s health. The
postnatal care visits provide an opportunity for assessing the nutritional status of women in the
post-partum period.


```
Recommended Action 21:
```
```
Educate and counsel women on adoption of healthy eating behaviour during
preconception, pregnancy, the breastfeeding and post-natal period.
```
Successful implementation will involve the following actions:

Comprehensive nutrition assessment should be conducted on the woman’s first contact and
with every visit at the health facility, which includes the psycho-social, nutrition and medical
history, physical assessment, and relevant laboratory investigations

```
•	 Encourage pregnant women, breastfeeding, and post-partum women to eat a variety
of foods, based on local availability and accessibility in adequate amounts to meet their
nutritional requirements (Annex 5):
```
```
o It is particularly important that underweight women increase their energy intake
to gain the recommended weight during pregnancy (Table 5). A woman at pre-
conception is considered underweight when the Mid Upper Arm Circumference
(MUAC) reading is < 21cm. A pregnant or lactating woman whose MUAC is less
than 23cm is considered to be underweight.
o Counsel pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to eat at least four meals a day, to
meet the energy needs of lactation ensuring variety of the different food groups.
o Greater investment to support social behaviour change programs to provide
information on food and the importance of vegetables, their preparation,
consumption and utilisation to address food and nutrition challenges
•	 Promote nutrition education on increased daily energy and protein intake for all pregnant
women to reduce risk of low birth weight neonates
```
```
•	 Advise the pregnant women identified as malnourished and at-risk of malnutrition
(underweight, obesity, and overweight), to have more frequent visits to receive
```
```
Table 5: Recommended Pregnancy Weight gain
```

```
appropriate care and thus benefit from closer nutritional and medical attention:
```
```
o The average weight gain under normal Body Mass Index (BMI) during pregnancy
is 0.5kg per month in the first trimester: and 1kg to 1.5kg per month in the second
and third trimesters
o Promote intake of folic acid during the preconception period and during the first
trimester to prevent neural tube defects in new-born babies
o Encourage mothers to avoid intake of alcohol and other harmful substances (e.g.
tobacco, nicotine, marijuana).
```
**2.3.3.2 Promoting Physical Activity**

The benefits of physical exercises include preventing excess weight gain, combating health
conditions and diseases, improving mood, and boosting energy as well as promoting better
sleep. Physical activity during pregnancy helps to reduce constipation, improves posture, and
promotes muscle tone and strength.

```
Recommended Action 22:
```
```
Promote physical activity/exercises during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and
post-partum period.
```
Successful implementation should be in line with global recommendations^31 and MoH polices
and guidelines^28 and will involve the following:

Counsel on the benefits of regular physical exercises

```
o Encourage pregnant women, post-partum women and breastfeeding mothers to
engage in exercises, particularly those whose routine does not involve physical
activity, for example recreational or leisure-time physical activity, walking or
cycling, occupational (i.e. work), household chores, play, games, sports, or planned
exercise, in the context of daily, family, and community activities. Women should
choose activities with minimal risk of loss of balance, fetal trauma. However,
women involved in work overload should be counselled to undertake rest to
minimize energy over expenditure
o For non-pregnant women of reproductive age, encourage the mother to
accumulate at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity
throughout the week or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical
activity throughout the week.
```
**2.3.3.3 Micro-nutrient Supplementation**

The increased demand for micro-nutrients during pregnancy, post-partum, and the breastfeed-
ing period implies that deficiencies are likely to occur when the mother has insufficient intake
and/or reserves. The deficiencies can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality during the
pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum period.


```
Recommended Action 23:
```
```
Provide folic acid and iron supplementation to all pregnant and lactating
mothers within three months after delivery.
```
Successful implementation will require support to the following:

```
•	 Assess all pregnant women attending antenatal care for anaemia using physical, clinical
and/ or laboratory tests. Iron and folic acid are important in production of red blood cells
(RBC), new genetic material and normal development of the foetus;
```
```
o Pregnant women with normal haemoglobin levels, mild or moderate anaemia shall
be counselled on diversification of their diet, with supplementation of iron and folic
acid (Table 6)
o Pregnant women should be counselled on dietary diversification and supplementation.
Pregnant women with severe anaemia (haemoglobin levels of <7.0g/dl) (Table 7),
shall be counselled on diversification of their diet and treated for anaemia, which may
include blood transfusion as advised by a medical profesisonal^33.
```

**Severe** <7g/dl Dietary diversification and treatment for anemia which may
include blood transfusion
**Source:** _WHO haemoglobin concentrations for the diagnosis of anaemia 2011_

```
•	 Counsel pregnant women to consume foods rich in micronutrients and calcium such as
pumpkins, green leafy vegetables, soya beans, okra, pawpaw, and foods fortified with
vitamin A like cooking oil and wheat flour fortified with iron
```
```
•	 The following micronutrient supplementation or nutrition practices should be adhered
to:
```
```
o Vitamin A is important during pregnancy for embryonic development, mucous
membranes, infection resistance, bone growth and fat metabolism. Dietary intake of
foods containing vitamin A is recommended. For example, carrots, pumpkins, green
leafy vegetables, paw paws, foods fortified with vitamin A like vegetable cooking oil
and margarines
o Supplementation with vitamin A is NOT recommended because it provides high
doses that could be harmful to the foetus leading to birth defects and liver toxicity
o Daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation with 30–60mg of elemental iron and
400μg (0.4mg) of folic acid is recommended for pregnant women, to prevent maternal
```

```
anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birth weight and preterm birth
o In settings where anaemia in pregnant women is a severe public health problem
(≥40 per cent of pregnant women have anaemia with haemoglobin concentration
<11.0 g/dl), 60mg of elemental iron is the preferred dose
o Provide de-worming tablets to all pregnant women during the second and third
trimesters. 400mg of albendazole during the second trimester, and 400mg during
the third trimester in line with the Uganda Maternal Nutrition Guidelines 201032.
o All postnatal women should be given routine iron and folic acid supplementation
within six weeks of delivery and be counselled to ensure compliance with the
recommended dosage of one tablet per day for three months.
```
```
•	 Counsel pregnant and breastfeeding women to consume iodized salt to prevent Iodine
deficiency diseases;
```
```
o Iodine is important for foetal development and deficiency during pregnancy leads to
cretinism that is characterized by mental retardation, stunted growth, with hearing
and sight defects. Deficiency of iodine is associated with enlargement of the thyroid
gland (goitre) in the mother.
•	 Pregnant women should sleep under ITNs and receive IPT with Fansidar (three tablets
of Fansidar during the second trimester, and three tablets during the third trimester) as
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT).
```
#### 2.3.4 Maternal Nutrition in Emergency situations.......................................................

Hunger and malnutrition tend to be rampant in emergency situations making pregnant women
and breastfeeding mothers in particular more vulnerable. Besides wasting, micronutrient
deficiencies are common in emergency-affected populations.

```
Recommended Action 24:
```
```
Counsel and support pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers in emergency
settings to have a balanced diet.
```
Successful implementation of nutrition interventions within emergency situations will involve
the following:

```
•	 Prioritize the pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and mothers of children under the
age of two years during the distribution of food rations by the humanitarian programmes
to meet their energy and other nutrient needs
•	 Provide balanced energy and protein food supplementation rations for pregnant women
and, breastfeeding mothers for better health and nutritional outcomes
•	 Provide nutrition education on increasing daily energy and protein intake and fortified
foods for pregnant women to reduce the risk of low birth weight neonates
•	 Continue provision of iron and folic acid supplements to all the pregnant women and
```

```
breastfeeding mothers
•	 Provide deworming tablets.
```
#### 2.3.5 Maternal Nutrition in the context of COVID-19..................................................

Women of reproductive age, pregnant and lactating women should continue accessing health
and nutrition services even in the context of COVID-19 in line with the global recommendations^34
(Annex 8) and national guidance on continuity of essential health services^26 :

```
•	 Maintain continuity of ANC and PNC as essential services for all pregnant and lactating
women in the context of COVID-19
```
```
•	 Prioritize the needs of at-risk women as per WHO and/or national guidelines where the
COVID-19 response requires scaling back of service delivery
```
```
•	 Adapt service delivery platforms and schedules to maintain continuity of nutrition
services and supplies for target beneficiaries while protecting health care workers
```
```
•	 Provide nutrition care and support services to all women (e.g. counselling, access to
nutrient dense local food, micronutrient supplements)
```
```
•	 Mainstream and integrate nutrition services in ongoing COVID-19 response
```
```
•	 Ensure psychosocial support to women during ANC and PNC periods
```
```
•	 Prevent commercial exploitation of COVID-19 through unnecessary use of specialized
foods and supplements, and spill over to those who do not need them
```
```
•	 Collaborate with gender-responsive social protection programmes (e.g. in-kind food,
vouchers, cash) and other emergency economic schemes to cover the needs of at-risk
women in food insecure households
```
```
•	 Counsel on importance of healthy diets for boosting an individual’s immunity, safe food
preparation, eating well on a budget, hygiene, managing stress, as well as information
on assistance for mental health.
```

# 03 MONITORING AND EVALUATION


### 3.1 Introduction...........................................................................................................

Monitoring and evaluation at all levels will be done to ensure that the implementation of the
guidelines is proceeding well and that the desired results are being achieved and documented.
The indicators for monitoring and evaluation of these guidelines are aligned to the Global
Strategy for Women’s, Children’s, and Adolescents’ Health^35 which is aligned to the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).^3 It has been structured to include the core set of indicators for
monitoring progress towards attainment of the SDGs. It includes output indicators to support
monitoring the programme and situation-specific progress, which in-turn inform decision-
making at the implementation level.

The Ministry of Health will track indicators through the available Health Management Information
System (HMIS) from which quarterly reports will be generated for dissemination during
scheduled meetings and other related fora. Capacity building will be required to strengthen
utilization of data captured for MIYCAN throughout the Health Management Information
System.

### (The Code).................................................................................................. Annex 2: Provisions for the regulations on marketing of Infant and Young Child foods

**Child foods (The Code)**

```
Summary of the main provisions of the CODE on Marketing Breast Milk
Substitutes for Uganda
```
```
•	 No advertising of breast milk substitutes and other similar products to the
public
•	 No free samples to mothers
```
```
•	 No promotion in health service facilities

```

### Annex 3: Maternity Protection...................................................................................

```
The main provisions of the 2000 Convention can be summarized as follows:
```
```
•	 Applies to all employed women, - including those in atypical forms of
dependent work
```
```
•	 Provides for 14 weeks maternity leave (12 weeks in the previous 1954
Convention)
```

the same rate as at the end of maternity leave
```
```
•	 Includes the right to one or more daily breaks or a daily reduction of hours of

```
```
•	 These breaks or the reduction of daily hours of work shall be counted as
working time and remunerated accordingly.
```
```
Recommendation 191 of MPC 183 of 2000 (still in draft):
```
```
•	 An increase in the length of maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks
```
```
•	 Facilities for breastfeeding at or near the workplace
```
```
•	 Adoptive parents have the right to maternity leave
```
```
•	 Adoptive parents have a right to maternity benefits.
```

### Annex 4: The BFHI principles.....................................................................................

```
1) Appropriate care to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding is the re-
sponsibility of every facility providing maternity and new-born services. This
includes private facilities, as well as public ones, and large as well as small
facilities
```
```
2) Compliance with the national standards for the protection, promotion, and
support for breastfeeding in all facilities providing maternity and new-born
services, based on the updated 14 requirements to Successful Breastfeeding
for Uganda
```
```
3) The Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative must be integrated with other initiatives
for maternal and new-born health, health-care improvement, health-systems
strengthening and quality assurance
```
```
4) To ensure that health-care providers have the competencies to implement the
BFHI, this topic needs to be integrated into pre-service training curricula. In
addition, in-service training needs to be provided when competencies are not
yet met
```
```
5) Public recognition of facilities that implement the 14 requirements to Successful
Breastfeeding and comply with the national guidance criteria is one way to
incentivize quality improvement. Several other incentives exist, ranging from
compliance with national facility standards to performance-based financing
```
```
6) Regular internal monitoring is a crucial element of both quality improvement
and ongoing quality assurance.
```
```
7) External assessment is a valuable tool for validating the quality of maternity
and new-born services
```
```
8) External assessments should be sufficiently streamlined into existing mech-
anisms that can be implemented sustainably.
```

### COVID-19 .................................................................................................... Annex 7: Ministry of Health: Decision tree on Infant Feeding in the context of


### Annex 8: Maternal Diets and Nutrition in the Context of COVID-19..........................

**_01. Service Delivery for women should be Guided by Local Adaptations of_**
    **_International recommendations._**

```
•	 Maintain continuity of ANC and PNC as essential services for all women in the context of
COVID-19 including delivery of essential maternal nutrition interventions which includes
nutrition and breastfeeding counseling, weight gain monitoring, MUAC screening,
micronutrient supplements, and deworming prophylaxis while implementing infection
prevention and control procedures to risk COVID-19 transmission [3, 4, 17]
```
```
•	 Introduce multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) for women to ensure adequate
micronutrient intake in populations with a high prevalence of nutritional deficiencies or
where food distribution is disrupted [5, 6]
```
```
•	 Prioritize the needs of at-risk women as per WHO and/or national guidelines where the
COVID-19 response requires scaling back of service delivery.
```
```
•	 Adapt service delivery platforms and schedules to maintain continuity of health services
while protecting health care workers and women such as:
```
```
o Apply WHO or national operational guidance on essential services, PPE and infection
prevention and control during health care and for health care workers caring for
patients [3, 9, 10]
```
```
o Modify workflow and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to reduce waiting times
and promote physical distancing
```
```
o Consider alternative service delivery modalities (telemedicine, mobile phone, home
visits) for counseling and screening at-risk women for danger signs
```
```
o Deploy staff to COVID-19 hot-spots and task shift services to community health
workers/volunteers in settings with a high case load
```
```
o Identify approaches to activate community outreach in urban settings.
```
```
•	 Postpone routine ANC and PNC services or provide alternative delivery platforms
for women with suspected, probable, or confirmed mild COVID-19 not requiring
hospitalization until cases are resolved
```
```
•	 Provide nutritional support (e.g. counselling, access to nutrient dense local food,
micronutrient supplements) for at-risk women or women with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 and isolated at home. Refer to WHO and/or national guidelines on home care
and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 [7, 8]
```
```
•	 Promote, protect, and support skin-to-skin contact for new born babies, timely-initiation
of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding. Prioritize continuation of optimal breastfeeding
counselling and support for all pregnant women and mothers with infants and young
children
```
```
•	 Ensure psychosocial support to women during ANC and PNC contacts
```

```
•	 Develop plans to resume routine service delivery as soon as mobility restrictions are
lifted
```
**_2. Essential Nutrition commodities should be available for Women for Service_**
    **_delivery._**

```
•	 Forecast and pre-position essential nutrition commodities (e.g. MMS, iron and folic
acid, deworming prophylaxis, calcium) for 2–3 months, close to service delivery while
ensuring adequate storage conditions
```
```
•	 Organize food distribution close to homes/communities to facilitate women’s access
[11]. Refer to IASC and WFP SOPs on alternative food distribution in the context of
COVID-19 [12]
```
```
•	 Increase the amount/reduce the frequency of essential nutrition commodities dispensed
to women (e.g. a 3-month supply) where disruptions in routine healthcare service
contacts are likely, supported by sensitization on their appropriate storage and use.
```
**_3. Food Systems should Protect the Diets of Women._**

```
•	 Undertake a rapid assessment of markets to identify immediate and longer-term policy
and programme actions to ensure access to locally available, nutritious, safe, affordable,
and sustainable foods
```
```
•	 Support and maintain local food production systems to ensure availability of staple foods,
fresh fruits and vegetables, and high protein foods in markets and retailers
```
```
•	 Ensure that major retailers, local markets, and shops remain open and retailers follow
hygiene, marketing and social distancing recommendations
```
```
•	 Strengthen food safety monitoring capacities (including for food fortification)
```
```
•	 Report price gouging and other violations
```
```
•	 Ensure safeguards are in place to avoid conflict of interest from companies marketing
breast milk substitutes and foods for infants and young children and women and ensure
that donations or free supplies are prohibited. Prevent commercial exploitation of
COVID-19 through unnecessary use of specialized foods and supplements, and spill
over to those who do not need them.
```
**_4. Social Protection Programmes should be expanded to cover the needs of Women._**

```
•	 Introduce or expand gender-responsive social protection programmes (e.g. in-kind food,
vouchers, cash) and other emergency economic schemes to cover the needs of at-risk
women in food insecure households
```
```
•	 Consider the appropriateness of modalities to effectively reach and support the nutritional
needs of at-risk women
```
```
•	 Advocate for the inclusion of high-quality nutritious foods (such as lentils, fortified
cereals, and oil) in food-based safety net schemes
```

food environments, and behaviours on women and the quality of women’s diets
```
```
•	 Encourage adoption of regulations and laws that control marketing of ultra-processed
foods and prevent misleading commercial messaging and exploitation
