# 2.3 MATERNAL NUTRITION

## 2.3.1 Introduction

Malnutrition in pregnant women contribute to an intergenerational cycle of nutrition problems,
which manifest as stillbirths, miscarriages, low birth weight babies, growth failure, increased risk
of maternal and neonatal mortality, impaired cognitive development, sub-optimal productivity in
adults and reduced economic growth for the nation. Efforts geared to preventing malnutrition
in women with a focus before, during and after pregnancy and during breastfeeding is the
direction of the government in breaking this intergenerational cycle and its manifestations.

A mother’s nutritional status, diet and lifestyle, therefore, influences pregnancy and lactation
outcomes and can have lasting effects on her offspring’s health. For optimal child development
outcomes, maternal physical and mental health should be coordinated. In other words,
interventions to promote the survival and wellbeing of both children and their caregivers should
be prioritized for optimal early childhood development. Preventing maternal malnutrition should
encompass programmes empowering women with knowledge and information on healthy
diets and nutrition to improve their nutrient intake as well as monitoring weight gain during
pregnancy and prevention and control of micronutrient deficiencies. This guideline builds onto
the maternal nutrition guidelines of 2010^32.

### 2.3.2 Objectives.........................................................................................................

Within the context of maternal nutrition, the objectives of the guidelines are as follows:

1. To provide a framework for prevention of under nutrition, anaemia, overweight, and
    obesity among the pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers
2. To promote provision of quality maternal nutrition services at the health facility and
    community levels.

#### .......................................................................................................................... 2.3.3 Recommended actions to promote and support optimal maternal nutrition

**_2.3.3.1 Nutrition Education and Counselling on Healthy Diet_**

There are increased macro- and micro-nutrient needs during pregnancy to cater for growth
of the foetus, placenta, and other maternal tissues, which call for extra energy and protein
intake. Without corresponding increased intake, the body’s own reserves are used, leaving
the pregnant woman weakened and vulnerable to maternal and foetal complications, including
death. Antenatal care offers an opportunity to assess and monitor the nutritional status of a
pregnant woman throughout the period.

Nutritional requirements during the post-partum period are greater than during pregnancy due
to the need to produce breast milk, promote recovery and sustain the mother’s health. The
postnatal care visits provide an opportunity for assessing the nutritional status of women in the
post-partum period.


```
Recommended Action 21:
```
```
Educate and counsel women on adoption of healthy eating behaviour during
preconception, pregnancy, the breastfeeding and post-natal period.
```
Successful implementation will involve the following actions:

Comprehensive nutrition assessment should be conducted on the woman’s first contact and
with every visit at the health facility, which includes the psycho-social, nutrition and medical
history, physical assessment, and relevant laboratory investigations

```
•	 Encourage pregnant women, breastfeeding, and post-partum women to eat a variety
of foods, based on local availability and accessibility in adequate amounts to meet their
nutritional requirements (Annex 5):
```
```
o It is particularly important that underweight women increase their energy intake
to gain the recommended weight during pregnancy (Table 5). A woman at pre-
conception is considered underweight when the Mid Upper Arm Circumference
(MUAC) reading is < 21cm. A pregnant or lactating woman whose MUAC is less
than 23cm is considered to be underweight.
o Counsel pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to eat at least four meals a day, to
meet the energy needs of lactation ensuring variety of the different food groups.
o Greater investment to support social behaviour change programs to provide
information on food and the importance of vegetables, their preparation,
consumption and utilisation to address food and nutrition challenges
•	 Promote nutrition education on increased daily energy and protein intake for all pregnant
women to reduce risk of low birth weight neonates
```
```
•	 Advise the pregnant women identified as malnourished and at-risk of malnutrition
(underweight, obesity, and overweight), to have more frequent visits to receive
```
```
Table 5: Recommended Pregnancy Weight gain
```

```
appropriate care and thus benefit from closer nutritional and medical attention:
```
```
o The average weight gain under normal Body Mass Index (BMI) during pregnancy
is 0.5kg per month in the first trimester: and 1kg to 1.5kg per month in the second
and third trimesters
o Promote intake of folic acid during the preconception period and during the first
trimester to prevent neural tube defects in new-born babies
o Encourage mothers to avoid intake of alcohol and other harmful substances (e.g.
tobacco, nicotine, marijuana).
```
**2.3.3.2 Promoting Physical Activity**

The benefits of physical exercises include preventing excess weight gain, combating health
conditions and diseases, improving mood, and boosting energy as well as promoting better
sleep. Physical activity during pregnancy helps to reduce constipation, improves posture, and
promotes muscle tone and strength.

```
Recommended Action 22:
```
```
Promote physical activity/exercises during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and
post-partum period.
```
Successful implementation should be in line with global recommendations^31 and MoH polices
and guidelines^28 and will involve the following:

Counsel on the benefits of regular physical exercises

```
o Encourage pregnant women, post-partum women and breastfeeding mothers to
engage in exercises, particularly those whose routine does not involve physical
activity, for example recreational or leisure-time physical activity, walking or
cycling, occupational (i.e. work), household chores, play, games, sports, or planned
exercise, in the context of daily, family, and community activities. Women should
choose activities with minimal risk of loss of balance, fetal trauma. However,
women involved in work overload should be counselled to undertake rest to
minimize energy over expenditure
o For non-pregnant women of reproductive age, encourage the mother to
accumulate at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity
throughout the week or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical
activity throughout the week.
```
**2.3.3.3 Micro-nutrient Supplementation**

The increased demand for micro-nutrients during pregnancy, post-partum, and the breastfeed-
ing period implies that deficiencies are likely to occur when the mother has insufficient intake
and/or reserves. The deficiencies can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality during the
pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum period.


```
Recommended Action 23:
```
```
Provide folic acid and iron supplementation to all pregnant and lactating
mothers within three months after delivery.
```
Successful implementation will require support to the following:

```
•	 Assess all pregnant women attending antenatal care for anaemia using physical, clinical
and/ or laboratory tests. Iron and folic acid are important in production of red blood cells
(RBC), new genetic material and normal development of the foetus;
```
```
o Pregnant women with normal haemoglobin levels, mild or moderate anaemia shall
be counselled on diversification of their diet, with supplementation of iron and folic
acid (Table 6)
o Pregnant women should be counselled on dietary diversification and supplementation.
Pregnant women with severe anaemia (haemoglobin levels of <7.0g/dl) (Table 7),
shall be counselled on diversification of their diet and treated for anaemia, which may
include blood transfusion as advised by a medical profesisonal^33.

```
•	 Counsel pregnant women to consume foods rich in micronutrients and calcium such as
pumpkins, green leafy vegetables, soya beans, okra, pawpaw, and foods fortified with
vitamin A like cooking oil and wheat flour fortified with iron
```
```
•	 The following micronutrient supplementation or nutrition practices should be adhered
to:
```
```
o Vitamin A is important during pregnancy for embryonic development, mucous
membranes, infection resistance, bone growth and fat metabolism. Dietary intake of
foods containing vitamin A is recommended. For example, carrots, pumpkins, green
leafy vegetables, paw paws, foods fortified with vitamin A like vegetable cooking oil
and margarines
o Supplementation with vitamin A is NOT recommended because it provides high
doses that could be harmful to the foetus leading to birth defects and liver toxicity
o Daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation with 30–60mg of elemental iron and
400μg (0.4mg) of folic acid is recommended for pregnant women, to prevent maternal
```

```
anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birth weight and preterm birth
o In settings where anaemia in pregnant women is a severe public health problem
(≥40 per cent of pregnant women have anaemia with haemoglobin concentration
<11.0 g/dl), 60mg of elemental iron is the preferred dose
o Provide de-worming tablets to all pregnant women during the second and third
trimesters. 400mg of albendazole during the second trimester, and 400mg during
the third trimester in line with the Uganda Maternal Nutrition Guidelines 201032.
o All postnatal women should be given routine iron and folic acid supplementation
within six weeks of delivery and be counselled to ensure compliance with the
recommended dosage of one tablet per day for three months.
```
```
•	 Counsel pregnant and breastfeeding women to consume iodized salt to prevent Iodine
deficiency diseases;
```
```
o Iodine is important for foetal development and deficiency during pregnancy leads to
cretinism that is characterized by mental retardation, stunted growth, with hearing
and sight defects. Deficiency of iodine is associated with enlargement of the thyroid
gland (goitre) in the mother.
•	 Pregnant women should sleep under ITNs and receive IPT with Fansidar (three tablets
of Fansidar during the second trimester, and three tablets during the third trimester) as
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT).
```
#### 2.3.4 Maternal Nutrition in Emergency situations.......................................................

Hunger and malnutrition tend to be rampant in emergency situations making pregnant women
and breastfeeding mothers in particular more vulnerable. Besides wasting, micronutrient
deficiencies are common in emergency-affected populations.

```
Recommended Action 24:
```
```
Counsel and support pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers in emergency
settings to have a balanced diet.
```
Successful implementation of nutrition interventions within emergency situations will involve
the following:

```
•	 Prioritize the pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and mothers of children under the
age of two years during the distribution of food rations by the humanitarian programmes
to meet their energy and other nutrient needs
•	 Provide balanced energy and protein food supplementation rations for pregnant women
and, breastfeeding mothers for better health and nutritional outcomes
•	 Provide nutrition education on increasing daily energy and protein intake and fortified
foods for pregnant women to reduce the risk of low birth weight neonates
•	 Continue provision of iron and folic acid supplements to all the pregnant women and
```

```
breastfeeding mothers
•	 Provide deworming tablets.
```
#### 2.3.5 Maternal Nutrition in the context of COVID-19..................................................

Women of reproductive age, pregnant and lactating women should continue accessing health
and nutrition services even in the context of COVID-19 in line with the global recommendations^34
(Annex 8) and national guidance on continuity of essential health services^26 :

```
•	 Maintain continuity of ANC and PNC as essential services for all pregnant and lactating
women in the context of COVID-19
```
```
•	 Prioritize the needs of at-risk women as per WHO and/or national guidelines where the
COVID-19 response requires scaling back of service delivery
```
```
•	 Adapt service delivery platforms and schedules to maintain continuity of nutrition
services and supplies for target beneficiaries while protecting health care workers
```
```
•	 Provide nutrition care and support services to all women (e.g. counselling, access to
nutrient dense local food, micronutrient supplements)
```
```
•	 Mainstream and integrate nutrition services in ongoing COVID-19 response
```
```
•	 Ensure psychosocial support to women during ANC and PNC periods
```
```
•	 Prevent commercial exploitation of COVID-19 through unnecessary use of specialized
foods and supplements, and spill over to those who do not need them
```
```
•	 Collaborate with gender-responsive social protection programmes (e.g. in-kind food,
vouchers, cash) and other emergency economic schemes to cover the needs of at-risk
women in food insecure households
```
```
•	 Counsel on importance of healthy diets for boosting an individual’s immunity, safe food
preparation, eating well on a budget, hygiene, managing stress, as well as information
on assistance for mental health.
