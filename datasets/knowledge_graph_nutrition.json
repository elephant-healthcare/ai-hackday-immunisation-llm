Recommended Action 3: Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources and vegetable oil). ```\n\nBreast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However, medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided.\n\nBabies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated.\n\nComplementary Feeding\n\nWhen a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious, and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins, and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency,\n\nAmount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations (FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3.\n\nChildren have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.\n\nRecommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nCounsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as complementary foods (Annex 5). • Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between meals (snacks) • Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse • Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages). • The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed. • All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils. • Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the infant during feeding times • Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old • Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording this growth • Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal duration of breastfeeding. • Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.\n\nTable 2: Summary of the Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nAge Group 6–8 Months 9–11 Months 12–23 Months Frequency • 2–3 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding; based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. Amount • Start with 2–3 tablespoons per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup • ½ cup of a 250 ml at each meal • ¾ of a 250 ml cup at each meal Thickness (consistency) • Start with thick porridge, well mashed foods. Continue with mashed family foods • Foods prepared with treated water. • Finely chopped or mashed food and foods that the baby can pick up with his/her fingers • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. • Family foods, chopped or mashed if necessary • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. Variety - Encourage mothers to include at least one type of locally available food from the three main food groups: Carbohydrates/fats/oils (energy-giving foods), plant/animal protein (bodybuilding), and vegetables and fruits (protecting foods). Active/Responsive Feeding - Mothers should be encouraged to feed their infants and young children patiently and actively and to use a separate plate for the infant to ensure adequate intake. Hygiene - Counsel mothers on hygienic food preparation and handling to avoid food contamination leading to diarrhoea and illness. Encourage the use of clean, open cups. Discourage use of feeding bottles, teats, or spouted cups as they are very difficult to clean.\n\nTable 3: Complementary Feeding Options for a Non-breastfed Child\n\nAge Frequency Amount Thickness Variety 6–24 months Add 1–2 extra meals, 1–2 snacks may be offered Same as above according to age group Same as above according to age group Same as above, plus 1 to 2 cups of milk per day + 2–3 cups of extra fluid especially in hot climates.\n\nSource: UNICEF Community IYCF Counselling Package, 2013\n\nSource: UNICEF Community IYCF Counselling Package, 2013\n\nTable 4: Recommendation Actions across the Life Cycle for IYCN\n\nLife Cycle Stage Recommended Actions 0–6 Months - Delay cord clamping as part of the essential newborn care package for Uganda. - Encourage and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding within one hour after birth. - Promote and support mothers to Exclusively Breastfeed (EBF) for the first six months of life. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation. - Protect, promote, and support optimal breastfeeding practices with the implementation of the national 14 BFHI requirements for successful breastfeeding in all facilities offering newborn and maternity services. - Promote growth monitoring and promotion. - Advocate to other sectors to protect breastfeeding and provide support to mothers to breastfeed by complying with the recommendations of the national regulations on foods for Infants and Young Children, the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly Resolutions. - Counsel lactating mothers to take sufficient and varied locally available food, along with adequate rest and support from family. 6–23 Months - Counsel caregivers to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, varied, and age-appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age with continued breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-appropriate responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation. - Promote the use of fortified foods (e.g., fortified flour, oil). - Promote the use of micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin A) and multiple micronutrient powders. - Promote the use of deworming tablets according to schedule (i.e., from one year of age and after every six months) or when needed. - Promote growth monitoring and promotion. - Increase integration initiatives with other sectors to increase access to safe, affordable, and appropriate complementary foods. 24–59 Months - Promote consumption of a nutritious, affordable, and safe diet. - Promote the use of fortified foods (e.g., fortified flour, oil, iodized salt). - Promote the use of micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin A supplementation) and micronutrient powder. - Promote the use of deworming tablets according to schedule (i.e., from one year of age and after every six months) or when needed. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-appropriate responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation.",

Recommended Action 1: ``` Counsel and support all pregnant women and mothers of children less than two years to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of life and to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six completed months of the infant’s life. Recommended Action 2: Counsel and support parents to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, and appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age while they continue breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond. Recommended Action 3: Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources and vegetable oil). ``` Breast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However, medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided. Babies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated. Complementary Feeding When a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious, and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins, and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency, Amount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations (FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3. Children have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.",

        "page_content": "Recommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices Counsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as complementary foods (Annex 5). • Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between meals (snacks) • Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse • Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages). • The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed. • All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils. • Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the infant during feeding times • Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old • Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording this growth • Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal duration of breastfeeding. • Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick. Table 2: Summary of the Complementary Feeding Practices Age Group 6–8 Months 9–11 Months 12–23 Months Frequency • 2–3 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding; based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. Amount • Start with 2–3 tablespoons per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup • ½ cup of a 250 ml at each meal • ¾ of a 250 ml cup at each meal Thickness (consistency) • Start with thick porridge, well mashed foods. Continue with mashed family foods • Foods prepared with treated water. • Finely chopped or mashed food and foods that the baby can pick up with his/her fingers • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. • Family foods, chopped or mashed if necessary • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. Variety - Encourage mothers to include at least one type of locally available food from the three main food groups: Carbohydrates/fats/oils (energy-giving foods), plant/animal protein (bodybuilding), and vegetables and fruits (protecting foods). Active/Responsive Feeding - Mothers should be encouraged to feed their infants and young children patiently and actively and to use a separate plate for the infant to ensure adequate intake. Hygiene - Counsel mothers on hygienic food preparation and handling to avoid food contamination leading to diarrhoea and illness. Encourage the use of clean, open cups. Discourage use of feeding bottles, teats, or spouted cups as they are very difficult to clean. Table 3: Complementary Feeding Options for a Non-breastfed Child Age Frequency Amount Thickness Variety 6–24 months Add 1–2 extra meals, 1–2 snacks may be offered Same as above according to age group Same as above according to age group Same as above, plus 1 to 2 cups of milk per day + 2–3 cups of extra fluid especially in hot climates.

Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins, and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency,\n\nAmount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations (FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3.\n\nChildren have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.\n\nRecommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nCounsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as complementary foods (Annex 5). • Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between meals (snacks) • Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse • Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages). • The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed. • All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils. • Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the infant during feeding times • Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old • Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording this growth • Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal duration of breastfeeding. • Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.\n\nTable 2: Summary of the Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nAge Group 6–8 Months 9–11 Months 12–23 Months Frequency • 2–3 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding; based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. Amount • Start with 2–3 tablespoons per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup • ½ cup of a 250 ml at each meal • ¾ of a 250 ml cup at each meal Thickness (consistency) • Start with thick porridge, well mashed foods. Continue with mashed family foods • Foods prepared with treated water. • Finely chopped or mashed food and foods that the baby can pick up with his/her fingers • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. • Family foods, chopped or mashed if necessary • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. Variety - Encourage mothers to include at least one type of locally available food from the three main food groups: Carbohydrates/fats/oils (energy-giving foods), plant/animal protein (bodybuilding), and vegetables and fruits (protecting foods). Active/Responsive Feeding - Mothers should be encouraged to feed their infants and young children patiently and actively and to use a separate plate for the infant to ensure adequate intake. Hygiene - Counsel mothers on hygienic food preparation and handling to avoid food contamination leading to diarrhoea and illness. Encourage the use of clean, open cups. Discourage use of feeding bottles, teats, or spouted cups as they are very difficult to clean.\n\nTable 3: Complementary Feeding Options for a Non-breastfed Child\n\nAge Frequency Amount Thickness Variety 6–24 months Add 1–2 extra meals, 1–2 snacks may be offered Same as above according to age group Same as above according to age group Same as above, plus 1 to 2 cups of milk per day + 2–3 cups of extra fluid especially in hot climates.\n\nSource: UNICEF Community IYCF Counselling Package, 2013\n\nSource: UNICEF Community IYCF Counselling Package, 2013\n\nTable 4: Recommendation Actions across the Life Cycle for IYCN\n\nLife Cycle Stage Recommended Actions 0–6 Months - Delay cord clamping as part of the essential newborn care package for Uganda. - Encourage and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding within one hour after birth. - Promote and support mothers to Exclusively Breastfeed (EBF) for the first six months of life. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation. - Protect, promote, and support optimal breastfeeding practices with the implementation of the national 14 BFHI requirements for successful breastfeeding in all facilities offering newborn and maternity services. - Promote growth monitoring and promotion. - Advocate to other sectors to protect breastfeeding and provide support to mothers to breastfeed by complying with the recommendations of the national regulations on foods for Infants and Young Children, the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly Resolutions. - Counsel lactating mothers to take sufficient and varied locally available food, along with adequate rest and support from family. 6–23 Months - Counsel caregivers to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, varied, and age-appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age with continued breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-appropriate responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation. - Promote the use of fortified foods (e.g., fortified flour, oil). - Promote the use of micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin A) and multiple micronutrient powders. - Promote the use of deworming tablets according to schedule (i.e., from one year of age and after every six months) or when needed. - Promote growth monitoring and promotion. - Increase integration initiatives with other sectors to increase access to safe, affordable, and appropriate complementary foods. 24–59 Months - Promote consumption of a nutritious, affordable, and safe diet. - Promote the use of fortified foods (e.g., fortified flour, oil, iodized salt). - Promote the use of micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin A supplementation) and micronutrient powder. - Promote the use of deworming tablets according to schedule (i.e., from one year of age and after every six months) or when needed. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-appropriate responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation.",

Recommended Action 1: ``` Counsel and support all pregnant women and mothers of children less than two years to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of life and to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six completed months of the infant’s life. Recommended Action 2: Counsel and support parents to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, and appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age while they continue breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond. Recommended Action 3: Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources and vegetable oil). ``` Breast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However, medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided. Babies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated. Complementary Feeding When a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious, and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins, and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency, Amount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations (FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3. Children have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.",

Recommended Action 3: Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources and vegetable oil). ```\n\nBreast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However, medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided.\n\nBabies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated.\n\nComplementary Feeding\n\nWhen a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious, and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins, and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency,\n\nAmount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations (FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3.\n\nChildren have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.\n\nRecommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nCounsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as complementary foods (Annex 5). • Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between meals (snacks) • Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse • Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages). • The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed. • All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils. • Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the infant during feeding times • Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old • Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording this growth • Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal duration of breastfeeding. • Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.\n\nTable 2: Summary of the Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nAge Group 6–8 Months 9–11 Months 12–23 Months Frequency • 2–3 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding; based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. Amount • Start with 2–3 tablespoons per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup • ½ cup of a 250 ml at each meal • ¾ of a 250 ml cup at each meal Thickness (consistency) • Start with thick porridge, well mashed foods. Continue with mashed family foods • Foods prepared with treated water. • Finely chopped or mashed food and foods that the baby can pick up with his/her fingers • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. • Family foods, chopped or mashed if necessary • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. Variety - Encourage mothers to include at least one type of locally available food from the three main food groups: Carbohydrates/fats/oils (energy-giving foods), plant/animal protein (bodybuilding), and vegetables and fruits (protecting foods). Active/Responsive Feeding - Mothers should be encouraged to feed their infants and young children patiently and actively and to use a separate plate for the infant to ensure adequate intake. Hygiene - Counsel mothers on hygienic food preparation and handling to avoid food contamination leading to diarrhoea and illness. Encourage the use of clean, open cups. Discourage use of feeding bottles, teats, or spouted cups as they are very difficult to clean.\n\nTable 3: Complementary Feeding Options for a Non-breastfed Child\n\nAge Frequency Amount Thickness Variety 6–24 months Add 1–2 extra meals, 1–2 snacks may be offered Same as above according to age group Same as above according to age group Same as above, plus 1 to 2 cups of milk per day + 2–3 cups of extra fluid especially in hot climates.\n\nSource: UNICEF Community IYCF Counselling Package, 2013\n\nSource: UNICEF Community IYCF Counselling Package, 2013\n\nTable 4: Recommendation Actions across the Life Cycle for IYCN\n\nLife Cycle Stage Recommended Actions 0–6 Months - Delay cord clamping as part of the essential newborn care package for Uganda. - Encourage and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding within one hour after birth. - Promote and support mothers to Exclusively Breastfeed (EBF) for the first six months of life. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation. - Protect, promote, and support optimal breastfeeding practices with the implementation of the national 14 BFHI requirements for successful breastfeeding in all facilities offering newborn and maternity services. - Promote growth monitoring and promotion. - Advocate to other sectors to protect breastfeeding and provide support to mothers to breastfeed by complying with the recommendations of the national regulations on foods for Infants and Young Children, the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly Resolutions. - Counsel lactating mothers to take sufficient and varied locally available food, along with adequate rest and support from family. 6–23 Months - Counsel caregivers to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, varied, and age-appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age with continued breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-appropriate responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation. - Promote the use of fortified foods (e.g., fortified flour, oil). - Promote the use of micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin A) and multiple micronutrient powders. - Promote the use of deworming tablets according to schedule (i.e., from one year of age and after every six months) or when needed. - Promote growth monitoring and promotion. - Increase integration initiatives with other sectors to increase access to safe, affordable, and appropriate complementary foods. 24–59 Months - Promote consumption of a nutritious, affordable, and safe diet. - Promote the use of fortified foods (e.g., fortified flour, oil, iodized salt). - Promote the use of micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin A supplementation) and micronutrient powder. - Promote the use of deworming tablets according to schedule (i.e., from one year of age and after every six months) or when needed. - Promote and support early childhood stimulation through age-appropriate responsive feeding, responsive care, play, and psycho-social stimulation.",

Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as complementary foods (Annex 5). • Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between meals (snacks) • Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse • Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages). • The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed. • All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly.

Recommended Action 3: Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources and vegetable oil). ```\n\nBreast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However, medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided.\n\nBabies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated.\n\nComplementary Feeding\n\nWhen a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious, and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins, and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency,\n\nAmount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations (FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3.\n\nChildren have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.\n\nRecommended Actions for Optimal Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nCounsel mothers to introduce age appropriate nutritionally adequate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age, while continuing to breastfeed until two years or beyond. Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as complementary foods (Annex 5). • Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between meals (snacks) • Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse • Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages). • The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed. • All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils. • Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the infant during feeding times • Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old • Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording this growth • Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal duration of breastfeeding. • Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.\n\nTable 2: Summary of the Complementary Feeding Practices\n\nAge Group 6–8 Months 9–11 Months 12–23 Months Frequency • 2–3 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding; based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding.

Recommended Action 1: ``` Counsel and support all pregnant women and mothers of children less than two years to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of life and to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six completed months of the infant’s life. Recommended Action 2: Counsel and support parents to introduce nutritionally adequate, safe, and appropriate complementary foods at six completed months of the infant’s age while they continue breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond. Recommended Action 3: Counsel and support caregivers and families to feed their children a diversified diet from a variety of locally available foods from the main food groups (fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, proteins from plant or animal sources and vegetable oil). ``` Breast milk is the ideal food for a child as it contains all nutrients that a child needs for healthy growth and development. Breast milk, including the first milk, colostrum, contains protective factors that provide immunity to the child against several illnesses including diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses. No other food, including water is required as breastfeeding alone is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of a child for the first six months of life. However, medicines that are prescribed by the medical professional can be provided. Babies should be placed on skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth and all mothers should be encouraged and supported to initiate breastfeeding their newborn baby within the first hour of life. Mothers should be encouraged to recognize cues when their babies are ready to breastfeed and counselled to breastfeed on demand, day and night. All mothers should be counselled and supported to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of the infant’s life unless medically contraindicated. Complementary Feeding When a child reaches six months of age, the child should receive safe, adequate, nutritious, and age-appropriate complementary foods alongside continued breastfeeding. Appropriate complementary foods (locally available) should be nutrient rich with adequate energy, vitamins, and minerals and without excess fats, salt, and sugar and should follow the Frequency, Amount, Thickness/consistency, Variety, Active/responsive feeding, Hygiene recommendations (FATVAH) per age groups as shown in Table 2 and 3. Children have small stomachs, and therefore should be fed on nutrient dense foods, starting with two meals at 6–8 months and gradually increasing 3/4–1 cup, 4–5 times a day at 12–23 months. The consistency of food should gradually evolve with age of the child and according to the child’s requirements and abilities. At one-year, young children should progress from eating soft to semi-solid then to solid food and finally family foods.",

Locally available and acceptable foods should be used as complementary foods (Annex 5). • Encourage mothers to feed their children regularly. Depending on the age of the child, the caregiver should be advised to feed their children (6–8 month-old child) twice a day and 4–5 times a day for older children: three main meals and two extra foods between meals (snacks) • Encourage mothers and caregivers to feed their children foods that are age appropriate. Feeding should be as frequent as needed by the child. The food to be given should be thick in consistency and nutrient rich and diverse • Counsel caregivers to avoid giving drinks and foods high in sugar, salt and fat (e.g. fast foods, sugar sweetened beverages). • The mothers and caregivers should be patient while feeding, actively encouraging the child. Children with disabilities may need more time to be fed. • All mothers and caregivers will need to ensure that good sanitation and hygiene practices are followed strictly. Complementary foods should be hygienically prepared stored, and fed with clean hands, dishes and utensils. • Encourage parents to practice active feeding, meaning that they should interact with the infant during feeding times • Encourage parents to ensure that their infants and children receive vitamin A supplements every six months starting at six months of age, and de-worming medicines every six months starting at one year of age until the children are five years old • Counsel parents to continue monitoring the growth of their children through five years of age and maintain the child growth card or mother/child health passport for recording this growth • Counsel and support parents to space births 2–3 years apart to achieve the optimal duration of breastfeeding. • Counsel mothers and caregivers on optimal IYCF practices, hygiene and sanitation practices and to seek timely medical care if the child falls sick.

Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. • 3–4 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeding. Based on a child’s appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered. Amount • Start with 2–3 tablespoons per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup • ½ cup of a 250 ml at each meal • ¾ of a 250 ml cup at each meal Thickness (consistency) • Start with thick porridge, well mashed foods. Continue with mashed family foods • Foods prepared with treated water. • Finely chopped or mashed food and foods that the baby can pick up with his/her fingers • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. • Family foods, chopped or mashed if necessary • Wash child’s hands if feeding him or herself. Variety - Encourage mothers to include at least one type of locally available food from the three main food groups: Carbohydrates/fats/oils (energy-giving foods), plant/animal protein (bodybuilding), and vegetables and fruits (protecting foods). Active/Responsive Feeding - Mothers should be encouraged to feed their infants and young children patiently and actively and to use a separate plate for the infant to ensure adequate intake. Hygiene - Counsel mothers on hygienic food preparation and handling to avoid food contamination leading to diarrhoea and illness. Encourage the use of clean, open cups. Discourage use of feeding bottles, teats, or spouted cups as they are very difficult to clean.
